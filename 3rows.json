It has been a wild adventure to get to this point of my life and it's something I wake up every day to going, \"Oh golly this really is still real and happening, that's so darling.\"<br>\n<br>\nFor anyone else like myself who really loves to break and find things, it truly is worth finding out how the folks&nbsp;who design the things that you like to break think. It also is most certainly helpful to be able to actually build that same thing from scratch beginning to end and ask yourself: is this actually secure, am I part of the problem, too?&nbsp;It has been an extroardinary experience working through that which I accept as a very happy challenge to myself.<br>\n<br>\nGoing into this program I knew I'd be going into a structured program with the trendy/popular full stack they're gearing students towards. What I didn't expect was for my mentor&nbsp;to figure out how I learn best, how I think or see problems, and use that to help me get a much richer and fuller understanding than the course itself alone. I'm a massive generalist so to have my mentor reach into my security and hacker community backgrounds&nbsp;to connect everything I know and the course together to fill in the gaps I do have has been absolutely wonderful.<br>\n<br>\nThe mentors are by far what truly make this program what it is for me. That's not to say the instructors and TA's aren't, they are most definitely that other huge chunk. Yet it really is up to you to decide on what path you want to take, what you want out of the program, and your mentor will be there to help guide you down the way you want to go.<br>\n<br>\nBefore I forget if you're in a Thinkful city like DC there are a lot of meet ups plus dinners for students and mentors together! They're absolutely darling and I highly recommend going to them even if you're not a registered student (for the regular public meet ups of course).<br>\n<br>\nThe full time program is intensive. If you come from prior experience, however, you may end some specific days during certain parts of the bootcamp&nbsp;earlier than expected. Especially if you know what '1=1' is for times you focus on databases. On the other hand you make up for it by helping other pairs understand it, working with your mentor on more advance concepts, and working on other things.<br>\n<br>\nPaired programming is something I never got to truly experience growing up messing around in the way we work in the full time program. There is a really lovely mix if folks in my cohort when it comes to prior experience. Getting a chance to work with everyone whether they have a comp sci degree or are a former lawyer is really exciting to see what they bring with them to the program.<br>\n<br>\nYou learn a lot about yourself, I don't think I've self reflected nearly this much about myself in how I interact with people in a long while.<br>\n<br>\nThere's so much I want to talk about alas I think this is a long review already. If you really want to talk more about the program with me it shouldn't be that hard to reach me! Hope you all have a darling day.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8875/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">2</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20A%20Darling%20Full-Time%20Web%20Development%20Bootcamp%20Experience%20%7C%20id%3A%208875\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Atlanta (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div class=\"verified\"><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8514\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8514\" id=\"review_8514\">Level Up your skills</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">5/20/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Tommy M. </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Atlanta </span><span class=\"reviewer-name\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-j-mcguire-4b7396a2\">Verified via LinkedIn</a></span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Level Up your skills</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I have been in the&nbsp;Thinkful Flexible Bootcamp for a little over a month now. I have learned so much within this short period of time&nbsp;with the very thorough curriculum, mentorship three times a week to help me work through my most recent problems, and the community that Thinkful has around it to propel me as a lifelong learner and student of software development. I took a lot of thought into picking a coding bootcamp that helped me accomplish my goals and flexible enough to give me the opportunity to grow as a programmer.</p>\n\n<p>I highly recommend Thinkful&nbsp;for anyone who wants to level up their skills. Whether it's server-side programming, learning asynchronous programming, or learning how to solve software problems with algorithms and data structures. I have been coding little over a year now. Since being in this program, I have learned invaluable advice from some of the best in the field. With all this said, &nbsp;this bootcamp gives an individual everything they need to succeed but it's up to the individual to apply and grow to acheive what they desire. Good luck and happy coding!</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8514/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">4</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Level%20Up%20your%20skills%20%7C%20id%3A%208514\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Full Time Web Development Bootcamp\"><div class=\"verified\"><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8418\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8418\" id=\"review_8418\">Game Changer</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">5/16/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Jacob A. </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Full Time Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span><span class=\"reviewer-name\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-askew-developer\">Verified via LinkedIn</a></span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Game Changer</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I would like to admit that I was a big skeptic of bootcamps and people claiming 'it was a life changing event for them', at first. Seemed like propaganda to me.</p>\n\n<p>One day a friend came up to me and said that he had joined Thinkful, out of the blue mind you. Of course, this had me a little more interested in bootcamps, because now I had an inside voice and a test dummy for me. Win!</p>\n\n<p>After hearing him talk about how great Thinkful is and showing me all that he has built in less than a month, I was in.</p>\n\n<p>I knew I had to make a change in my career soon, and Thinkful did that just that and more for me.</p>\n\n<p>After about 4 months in this course, I am still amazed how much I have actually learned in 4 months. 4 MONTHS. That is nothing realistically. But hear I am developing FULL_STACK apps, by myself and with others (pair programming is an indispensable&nbsp;skill to learn)!</p>\n\n<p>Even though I am paying a tuition, I still think I won't ever be able to repay them for everything I have accomplished. From becoming a developer to all the way to learning how to work better with others, it is all thanks to them!</p>\n\n<p>So if you are like I was, a skeptic, I would highly recommend you check out Thinkful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions about my experience at Thinkful or just want to talk more, please feel free to reach out to me on twitter:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacoboutlaw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/jacoboutlaw</a>&nbsp;or on my LinkedIn ^</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8418/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">10</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Game%20Changer%20%7C%20id%3A%208418\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div class=\"verified\"><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8409\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8409\" id=\"review_8409\">Awesome learning experience</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">5/16/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Hazel D. </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span><span class=\"reviewer-name\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hdoctor\">Verified via LinkedIn</a></span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Awesome learning experience</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>Before my first day of learning at Thinkful, I had minimal&nbsp;knowledge on programming. I dabbled with some exercises in Free Code Camp and Codeacademy, but I felt that I would personally benefit from a mentor&nbsp;who could help me further understand the logic of the code, answer my questions, and recommend best practices.&nbsp;I looked through a variety of online and on-site programs and thought that Thinkful fit my needs: it offered a flexible track (which was ideal since I worked full-time), emphasized the mentor-mentee model, had a supportive community both online and on-site, and a team from career services to guide you on the job hunt. ​</p>\n\n<p><strong>Curriculum:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I found Thinkful's curriculum to be organized and&nbsp;straightforward. They lay out the basics and take you through advanced lessons with examples and exercises. They also have assignments and capstones&nbsp;that help you really&nbsp;solidify what you have learned while being creative with your personal projects (which is always fun!).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I will say that there were some topics that I thought could have been explained clearly and thoroughly. With that, you would&nbsp;need to constantly use Google, StackOverflow and other resources to research topics that may seem unclear. To add onto this, you have your mentor, Thinkful/Slack community and Q&amp;A sessions hosted by mentors on a variety of topics&nbsp;that you can turn to for questions; they are usually very responsive and helpful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As many reviews here have said, this curriculum will be difficult at times. Given that there is so much to learn in&nbsp;a short amount of time, it is completely understandable that anyone can feel frustrated or overwhelmed (I know I did!). But don't give up! Throughout this track, you would need to stay patient, dedicated and willing to work hard. It will pay off nicely in the end, especially when you complete those capstones.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructors/Community:</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Students get an hour-long mentor session three times a week. Mentor sessions could include anything from curriculum Q&amp;As, coding exercises/pair programming, or interview prep. My mentor&nbsp;<span>Aleksandar Grbic&nbsp;has been nothing short of amazing. As&nbsp;someone who comes from a background completely unrelated to tech, I first felt intimidated by all the new information. Alex has helped me better understand programming concepts by offering clear&nbsp;explanations. For instance, I started off from&nbsp;\"What is an object??\" to building projects that use them.&nbsp;He has been patient, thorough, understanding, and would offer advice on real-world expectations in the world of web development, which is extremely valuable.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>This may vary by city, but we have a local Thinkful group managed by the awesome&nbsp;Peter Kim in Atlanta, GA. We&nbsp;meet&nbsp;bi-weekly to meet&nbsp;other Thinkful students and mentors, showcase capstone projects&nbsp;(and gaining feedback), go through coding challenges, and ask mentors questions. We also learn more about the local tech industry through meet-ups/events or job opportunities shared by mentors and students. I love my Thinkful family and their passion for coding. I would say that our meetings have truly enriched&nbsp;my experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Job Assistance:</strong></p>\n\n<p>While I am not yet at the point of working with the career services team, I have participated in a web conference&nbsp;that interviewed Thinkful graduates&nbsp;about&nbsp;their experiences on&nbsp;finding jobs. Overall, it seemed like a positive experience. I could also note other instances where people from the Thinkful community have assisted in making the&nbsp;job hunt easier. On Slack, students would post their resumes or portfolio pages for review and receive feedback. In my local Thinkful group, we would share opportunities to attend recruiting events together. There were&nbsp;also some mentors who would assist you in finding leads in some companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overall Experience:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm currently on my fourth month of the flexible web development track, and looking back, I have to say that I definitely learned so much that I can now confidently create awesome projects that I am passionate about. Because of its dedication to student success, I would highly recommend Thinkful.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8409/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">13</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Awesome%20learning%20experience%20%7C%20id%3A%208409\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div class=\"verified\"><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8329\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8329\" id=\"review_8329\">Why did I wait so long!!!</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">5/12/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Jeremy A. </span><span> • Student </span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span><span class=\"reviewer-name\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-almas-b51a07138\">Verified via LinkedIn</a></span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Why did I wait so long!!!</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p><span>Background:</span></p>\n\n<p>A close friend of mine at work very randomly one day said to me \"Jeremy, you are way too smart to be stuck working here for the rest of your life. &nbsp;I was reading an article about computer coding a couple days ago, I think you should check it out.\" &nbsp;To say computer coding was not on my radar, would not even give that under statement a fair shot as an under statement. &nbsp;Let's more accurately describe my knowledge/interest in computer coding ..... I have never one time in my entire life given it an iota of thought, until Kenny approached me with the suggestion. &nbsp;So, self-inventory time, as I'm sitting at home, a few hours after Kenny had unkowingly changed the path of my existence. &nbsp;Wife-yes, Offspring-yes, Mortgage-yes, Work Stability-yes, Great Friends-yes, Basic Needs Met-yes, Good Health-yes, Complacent-yes, L<span><span><span>ack</span><span>a</span><span>dai</span><span>si</span><span>cal-Yes, Indifferent-Yes Uninterested-yes. &nbsp;Immediately all neon arrows were pointing to the only part of my life that wasn't seemingly perfect, causing the last 4 inventory items to be Yes. &nbsp;I had been working the same brain-dead job for 7 years, and I was wasting away mentally without realizing it. &nbsp;So, yeah .... let's give computer coding a shot.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span>The Course:&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Currently, I am 35 years old.&nbsp; The first&nbsp;25, I spent nearly the entire year freezing to death, in nowhereville Michigan. &nbsp;The last 10, I have spent nearly the entire year sweating to death, in nowhereville Florida.</p>\n\n<p>The above statement at first glance, will more often then not, be perceived as a negative statement, because of three words. &nbsp;Human nature teaches us that freezing and sweating, and of course death, are not good things.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, I am 35 years old. &nbsp;The first&nbsp;25, I spent nearly the entire year cozied up next to the fireplace, in nowhereville Michigan. &nbsp;The last 10, I have spent nearly the entire year basking in the beautiful sun, in nowhereville Florida.</p>\n\n<p>Not so bad after a couple replacements were inserted, eh?</p>\n\n<p>I've been in the Flexible Web Development Bootcamp for just over 2 months. &nbsp;I quickly learned that if this is not something that you very very very very much, deep down, have the passion to&nbsp;apply/challenge/dedicate/sacrifice/trust yourself, to name a few ..... then you're going to view this job field as the first description of FL/MI. &nbsp;But, for me ... a fire has been lit. &nbsp;I have never been so enthralled and full of life, in my life. &nbsp;This short journey has already brought back so much of what I forgot I had inside of me, LIFE!

I had a few hobbies that surrounded computers (gaming, computer building) and I had spent some previous time with self study using free online resources and taking a couple community college CS courses. I had tried teaching myself C++ as a young teen and quickly realized how difficult that was, thus abandoning my early CS career. My current job was very stressful with long hours and no appreciation and little to show for it. So I can to the conclusion something had to be done and decided to look back at something that had interested me enough to attempt self learning with C++.</p>\n\n<p>The Course:&nbsp;<br>\nI spent 3 months in this Front-End Web Development course. At that time, it was said to usually take 3-4 months for most students. The material was not that deep and kept mostly to the surface of various web development topics. This was helpful for beginners and was nice to get a overall foundation, however, you soon got to a point where you needed more advanced knowledge in order to actually do anything real world related and the course did not have support for that. In addition, the course would almost always refer to outside resources for their course content. I understand that they did not want to reinvent the wheel when a wheel was already perfectly available; it still gave the nasty taste of a company charging heavy fees to just point you to the Internet. Obviously, this material is not easy, and if you're expecting something simple and fast, you're looking in the wrong field. Having said that, this course would be great for early beginners. Though, when it comes to job application time, you will not be prepared to land a job. The skills you gain in this course are insufficient for being employed and the projects are too simple and too superficial to be of any use for anyone or to showcase necessary skills.</p>\n\n<p>Mentors:&nbsp;<br>\nInitially, I was matched with a mentor who did seem very intelligent but not completely integrated into the Thinkful process. She was on the older side, which is perfectly fine, except she didn’t seem in touch with the most recent web development tools and frameworks, which was severely limited since that’s what the course was made for. She was never prepared for our meetings and only relied on me to ask questions. This was a super frustrating experience for a new developer because I did not know what I did not know and was very much relying on my mentor’s expertise to help guide the way. If I just wanted to teach myself and ask questions when I knew I had them, I would have just done freecodecamp and stackoverflow. Ultimately, I should have switched mentors to see what else was out there.</p>\n\n<p>Job assistance:&nbsp;<br>\nUnfortunately, at the time of me taking this course, Thinkful promised assistance with job placement, however, they did absolutely nothing in this regard. I received no help, no communication, and no offer of assistance during my entire time in the course and since. I was very disappointed with this as even just reviewing my portfolio/online presence, or technical interview prep would have been great.</p>\n\n<p>Overall:<br>\nThis course was sub par even considering it cost less than other bootcamps. The material is challenging in that its a new field, but you do not dig very deep, they constantly link you to other materials, career services was non-existent for me, and my mentor was not helpful. The course may be different now, but my experience was not positive.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8202/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">9</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Sub-par%20%7C%20id%3A%208202\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div class=\"verified\"><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8083\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8083\" id=\"review_8083\">Great Course</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">4/29/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Walter Bottlick </span><span> • Senior Web Producer </span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span><span class=\"reviewer-name\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/walterbottlick\">Verified via LinkedIn</a></span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Great Course</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I took the Frontend Web Development course, and I found it to be&nbsp;great and my mentor&nbsp;very helpful.

future. &nbsp;I enrolled into the front-end web development courses and also the node course. &nbsp;My first mentor was great and we got along very well. &nbsp;Then in March, 2016, I was suddenly assigned to a different mentor without any prior warning. &nbsp;I logged in to the usual session time and was told that somebody new was going to guide me through. &nbsp;At first, everything was going well, but soon he started missing sessions with no notice. &nbsp;I should have asked to get another mentor, but felt I was very close to finishing so I continued with him.</p>\n\n<p>In July, 2016, my program director told me that he was confident I was ready to graduate and when I sent him my portfolio, he said that it was good enough for him and had me start working with a designer to polish it up. &nbsp;She gave me a few pointers to make my portfolio better. &nbsp;The issue with her was that she kept telling me to use my design skills, even though I never took design courses. &nbsp;I told her that I hadn't taken those courses and was only a developer, but she kept telling me to \"use your design skills, use your design skills!\"</p>\n\n<p>After three months, THREE MONTHS, of this, somehow another program director got looped into the discussion and he told me that my portfolio, the very same portfolio approved by the first program director, violated Thinkful's own standards for graduation portfolios. &nbsp;At this point, I had now been enrolled in the 6-8 month program for a full year and he wanted me to redo each and every single one of my projects in the portfolio. &nbsp;When I told him that it had been approved by the other director, and that I had been in the program for over a year, he said I only had to redo two of them.</p>\n\n<p>From November to December of 2016, I worked on it and the second director was telling me that everything was looking good and he would have somebody from career services reach out to me. &nbsp;All through January, 2017 I was getting this promise until one day I told him that I was tired of being strung along and either I would have contact with career services or get a refund of my tuition. &nbsp;Finally, I was put in contact with career services and started what was supposed to be six months of career placement assistance.</p>\n\n<p>She bailed after two months telling me that she would have to seek approval for more sessions with me. &nbsp;The problem with that was when I signed up, at this point, 18 months prior, I was given a promise of six full months of career placement assistance. &nbsp;Understandably, I was rather confused as to why she would only work with me for two months.</p>\n\n<p>I worked my tail off each day while I was taking my courses, coming home from a full-time job and putting in several hours in the evening, and several more Saturday and Sunday as well. &nbsp;I did what they asked of me and trusted them when they said I was ready to graduate and my portfolio was good enough to go. &nbsp;Now, I'm stuck in limbo, not having the promised career placement help, and they aren't responding to my emails. &nbsp;If I had to do this all over again, I would have chosen somebody else such as the Odin Project, where they don't charge tuition until after you get a job, or even Free Code Camp.</p>\n\n<p>Thinkful broke every promise they made to me. &nbsp;Every single one. &nbsp;I truly regret going through this bootcamp.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/7618/votes\">This Review Is

</span></span><br>\n<span><span>My full-time job was completely unrelated to programming. I had a few hobbies that surrounded computers (gaming, computer building) and I had just started working on the front-end portion of a free codecademy lesson (HTML/CSS). I was looking for another career that would challenge me everyday and could give me a way to be creative and design experiences for people for a variety of reasons. This career also has the benefit of bringing in more money than I was making at my other job.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>The Course: </span></span><br>\n<span><span>I've been in the 6-month flexible full stack course for about 4 months now. I have learned more practical technical skills in that time than I ever thought possible. With that said, this course is not easy, and if you're expecting something simple and fast, you're looking in the wrong field. The course is written to challenge you and force you to work through problems using skills its shown. It also challenges you to use the most important resource known to any developer: Google. I gave the Curriculum a 4/5 because at times I am frustrated by it, but that is remedied by the one-on-one attention I'm given from my mentor.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Mentors: </span></span><br>\n<span><span>Initially, I was matched with a mentor who did not seem completely onboard with the whole process. I'm not sure if he was new or burnt out, but our first two conversations weren't what I was hoping to get out of the course. I spoke to my program manager and he was immediately willing to move me to another mentor, the one I currently work with, without very much prompting. I was very happy with how flexible he was willing to be to make sure I got what I needed to learn. Just being able to be open and honest with the manager has been a huge help and my new mentor is also responsive to my needs as a learner. My program manager is also always willing to meet during times available on his calendy. This is a HUGE benefit because it affords me the contact of multiple professionals in the field, giving me that much more mentorship. On top of that, Q&amp;A sessions are available from a variety of other mentors during specific times, during which I'm able to ask specific questions. Funny enough, my mentor is very much into server-side coding, and my manager is the biggest CSS/front-end enthusiast I’ve met. Having both of them to teach and guide me has been absolutely amazing.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Job assistance: </span></span><br>\n<span><span>Although I haven't even reached the end of my time in Thinkful, I’m already able to work with local mentors to start a job search. It is extremely important to attend meetups if they are available in your area, as these provide opportunities to network and meet other professionals, some of whom may be hiring. At one such meetup, I made an arrangement with a Thinkful manager to showcase one of my projects and to meet some professionals in the field at a company nearby.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Overall:</span><br>\n<span>This course is for the dedicated and determined, but it's not like college or another school. You’re working with real professionals in the field who can teach you exactly what you need to be successful. </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/7403/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">42</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Full%20Stack%20Flexible%20Bootcamp%20%7C%20id%3A%207403\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div class=\"verified\"><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/6839\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_6839\" id=\"review_6839\">My Frontend Web Development Course Experience</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">2/8/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Robert Schamhart </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span><span class=\"reviewer-name\"><a href=\"https://github.com/Robs0207\">Verified via GitHub</a></span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">My Frontend Web Development Course Experience</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>Recently I completed the&nbsp;Frontend Web Development course (individual skilled course) after a period of 3 months, spending about 10/15 hours a week on the learning materials and exercises. Much more time, however, was spent on my capstone project in which you apply all you have learned.</p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;course was a great experience and very rewarding to me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The web portal is very user-friendly;</li>\n\t<li>The learning material is not dry and strikes the right balance between theory and practical hands-on examples;</li>\n\t<li>Being paired with a mentor, though&nbsp;is in my opinion, the real key to the success of Thinkful's course concept as it will motivate&nbsp;you to stay on track and in case stuck there is help&nbsp;out there. My mentor Andrew was amazing, very experienced, great communicator and very flexible in case life got in the way.

This was important because everyone feels burnout while learning this stuff and it helps to chat and get a little off topic before you start diving in again.</p>\n\n<p>Thinkful employees are professional. &nbsp;Everyone knows their stuff and takes the time to make sure you understand the answer to whatever you are asking. &nbsp;I've had days where I felt like learning to code is impossible and I wasnt cut out to code. &nbsp;Someone has always been there to help me learn and get back on track. &nbsp;As a side note, they never made me feel stupid for asking a question either. I really really liked that. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The mentors are amazing. &nbsp;My mentor has been coding for 17 years! &nbsp;He knows his stuff and asks questions in a way that makes me research and know my stuff. &nbsp;And if I dont know it, we go over and over and over it. &nbsp; Hes even given me extra coding exercises for when I needed extra practice. &nbsp;And he keeps me on track. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Also the curriculum. &nbsp;Dont get me wrong, you could probably find this stuff on the web for free, but hey, you arent getting the mock interviews, the chats with career services, extra workshops on everything from React to Github.. Not to mention the Q &amp; A sessions for hours a day and the slack channel for students and thinkful employees to jump in and chat.</p>\n\n<p>Listen, the bottom line is you get what you put in to it. &nbsp;Thinkful is a great program. &nbsp;I havent finished the course yet, but Im due to in about a &nbsp;month, and Im confident that Im getting the skills I need to succeed in todays programming atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Also special shoutout to Derek, program manager, who has talked me down from the walls and always is there to lend a helping hand. &nbsp;Hes seriously one of the best. &nbsp;Im lucky that he was part of my team.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8860/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">3</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Thinkful%20Review-Flexible%20Web%20Development%20%7C%20id%3A%208860\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"User Experience Design\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8672\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8672\" id=\"review_8672\">Great course</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">5/27/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Benny </span><span> • UX Designer, UI Developer </span><span></span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: User Experience Design </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Great course</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>The UX course was everything I needed it to be.

I went into the course with some degree of coding knowledge and a lot of expereince in non-technical web practices, user experience, journey etc.&nbsp; I run a small digital marketing/web business and I do a lot of web work using WordPress.&nbsp; I basically wanted to increase my technical skill-set and ultimately expand my offering to include (or at least start my journey towards offering) front-end development.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>On the positive side, I felt the course material was well written and had solid depth, and many of the challenges along the way were challenging and rewarding to complete.&nbsp; Additionally, getting assigned a mentor that you catch-up with weekly is great for staying on track.&nbsp; There's also a lot of flexibility in the final \"Capstone\" project to do essentially what you'd like assuming it meets the broad criteria.&nbsp; I liked this as it essentially meant I could roll out something which I could hopefully actually sell into a client in some form at a later date.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>On the negative side (and I'm really not a serial negative reviewer).&nbsp; The main disjoint for me was the amazing pre-sales help/responsive support vs the support once you are actually a student.&nbsp; Just to clarify, this is not a dig at my mentor but rather rather getting in touch anyone else.&nbsp; I felt that following submitting the Capstone there was a real dead-end and I was left thinking - have I finished?&nbsp; Did I pass?&nbsp; What can I do better?&nbsp; I sent many emails trying to clarify this process but no response, except for an automated one saying I would get a response!&nbsp;(I'm going to avoid the temptation to name names here).&nbsp; My mentor did respond who felt there should be an independent developer review but eventually he just said he was advised to do that himself in my case and I'd passed after a few minor iterations.&nbsp; I feel like he was kept in the dark as well to be honest.&nbsp; Ultimately, I would have loved some detailed feedback on my code and a formal pass email, certificate, something!&nbsp; $1500 USD and no \"closure\" just seems ridiculous to me.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>I'd also point out and this is really dependant on personal learning style but this course is all written with a number of code challenges along the way (you do this using CodePen or similar).&nbsp; Personally, I learn much better with at least some video content thrown in to reinforce concepts.&nbsp; I appreciate that as a developer you need to research yourself but still I would have benefited from some video content curated by Thinkful themselves (although they do provide some great links along the way).&nbsp; I don't recall a single video as part of the core curriculum.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span>In summary, I've come a long way in three months and this is partly due to this course.&nbsp; However, knowing what I know now could I do better elseware?&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; I'm currently going through the Treehouse FWED track which I'm already finding a lot more cost effective, interactive, and educational.&nbsp; I'm also slowly chipping away at free code camp which I think is a great free resource.&nbsp; My initial plan was to master the basics through this course and then progress to the Thinkful Angular course, however I'll be focusing elseware to expand my knowledge. &nbsp;I hate leaving a less than ideal review but I do feel like I've received less than ideal service in this case... it could be so much better thinkful! &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span>&nbsp;

I recently graduated and had an awesome experience. Here are some of the highlights of the program. \n\n1. The flexibility. I was able to continue to work my full time job without quitting. This was a huge necessity for me. I worked during the day and studied in the evenings and weekends. \n\n2. The one on one mentorship. As a novice, having a dedicated mentor that could refine my skills as I moved through the course was essential. They recently began to implement local mentors in some locations. I had a local mentor which was really helpful. Not only having a mentor with coding knowledge, but someone who had experience in the local job market was a plus. \n\n3. The price. I looked at a dozen or so boot camps and most of them were priced way out of my range. Thinkful was one of the few boot camps that I didn't feel extreme anxiety about paying for. They have many payment options including month to month, deferred and a third party loan company called SkillsFund. I used the SkillsFund loan and they were really easy to business with.\n\n4. The job report. Thinkful is one of the few boot camps that publishes job report statistics of their graduates. This was really reassuring to know where graduates usually go after finishing the course.\n\n5. The material. The course layout was designed really well. I had no experience in development before joining. The material is packaged in a way that makes it simple to learn fundamentals, practice what you've learned and use that knowledge to build applications. Each section is a building block from the previous.\n\n5. The Support. They want you to succeed and this is very apparent with the support system they've built. They have mentors that have open 'office hours' available from early in the morning to late at night to answer any questions you have. They also have a huge slack community that's available 24/7. So between your personal mentor, office hours and slack, you're always able to get help when you need it. \n\n6. The Community. All of the team members are beyond nice and genuinely care about your success and happiness. My program manager Derek was extremely helpful in making sure I had the support I needed throughout the course. The GM and Program Manager of Atlanta(Jas and Peter) do a great job of building the local community which is really helpful for current students and graduates. <p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8414/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">6</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Great%20Program%20%7C%20id%3A%208414\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8407\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8407\" id=\"review_8407\">Great experience.</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">5/16/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Yohann </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Great experience.</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>After researching&nbsp;coding botcamps, I chose Thinkful because: it offers&nbsp;the most relevant and up-to-date curriculum&nbsp;I've seen from online scholols; the teachers/program managers&nbsp;are very invoilved in your learning experience and are quick to respond.</p>\n\n<p>I started the Thinkful Felxible bootcamp with absolutely no prior experience in coding. The curriculum&nbsp;covers HTML, CSS, the command line (Git/GitHub etc)&nbsp;with lots of drills at the end of each&nbsp;lesson. They make sure you get solid foundations before you actually start programming in JavaScript and using JQuery, APIs etc.<br>\nOnce you have completed the front-end section, you move on to the server-side.&nbsp;You also learn about more advanced topics in Computer Science which is an aspect lots of bootcamps &nbsp;tend to overlook.</p>\n\n<p>Apart form the curriculum, the strength of this program lies in the projects you work on, the portfolio you build&nbsp;and the three weekly 1-1&nbsp;mentor sessions –coupled&nbsp;with lots of daily live Q&amp;A and workshops–&nbsp;that help you overcome the challenges of programming.</p>\n\n<p>This is an online school, however you are not on your own...far from it.<br>\nThanks to Kristen, Mark and Derek by the way.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nHighly recommended.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8407/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">10</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Great%20experience.%20%7C%20id%3A%208407\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Atlanta (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8403\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8403\" id=\"review_8403\">Thinkful for working moms</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">5/16/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Laura </span><span></span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Atlanta </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Thinkful for working moms</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I looked around at several bootcamps before choosing Thinkful. I moved ahead with them because they offer several options to 'try-before-you-buy' so I felt confident that if I decided this wasn't the right place for me, I could back out without loosing a ton of money. Once I got going, I realized I really loved to code and have been loving the courses&nbsp;ever since. I've been working as a nanny so I haven't been paying for child care for my own kid for the past few years and I realized if I did an in-person bootcamp, I would not only be paying for the school but also need to find care for her while I was there and not be able to work even part-time and that was too much. With Thinkful's flex-program, I've been able to keep working part-time and&nbsp;be with my daughter while working through the course materials. I still had the support of an individual mentor at all times and constant access to other support through Q&amp;A sessions and the slack community. Atlanta has also become a very tight-knit family where we meet up in person a couple of times a month so I wound up still getting some of the most fun parts of an in-person bootcamp without needing to leave everything else&nbsp;for 4+ months.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8403/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">7</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Thinkful%20for%20working%20moms%20%7C%20id%3A%208403\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8375\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8375\" id=\"review_8375\">Transparent Progress</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">5/15/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Bryan G </span><span></span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Transparent Progress</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I recently wanted to make a career switch, and thought that programming and software were always something that interested me. So, I decided to do research and research and research, and did not get anywhere until I saw thinkful. Up until that point, everything was either expensive, weird, or plain old garbage. So, I then got in touch with Benjy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>From there, he took care of my every concern and worry. Not only did he do that, but the onboarding process for this company is serious. The whole staff works to make sure you have everything you need to allow you to work hard and learn this tough stuff. So, with the help of thinkful, what I would have learned in 6 months on my own, I learned in a week with thinkful, no exaggeration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here is why. Plain and simple. When you learn, you need knowledge and practice. For knowledge, you need to know, what to learn and then best sources. Thinkful, gives you structure from A-Z, and guides you in the right direction. Different from being self taught and going at it blindly. This is more strategic honestly. On top of that your mentor is also there, so you have an expert right at your fingertips who actually becomes a friend like mine did. Then you need practice, and Thinkful gives you plenty of it. You learn through rigorous drills, and then capstone projects. Amazing way of learning, why? Well you practice all of the small pieces that will makeup your capstone later on. Practice makes perfect, you succeed in projects, and you will feel great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Also, YES, you could learn programming like anything else by yourself. But honestly, time is spare, so why waste it. Unless you actually like devling into the unkown, and don't give up, join Thinkful. They give you a free trial. No other bootcamp will care about you enough to let you try them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Shoutout to my mentor Juan, amazing guy. Will always be a friend and mentor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8375/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">4</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Transparent%20Progress%20%7C%20id%3A%208375\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8152\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8152\" id=\"review_8152\">I got a job!</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">5/2/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Deb T. </span><span></span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">I got a job!</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I started the Flexible Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp with Thinkful in summer 2016 with only some knowledge of HTML, and an awareness of CSS. &nbsp;I was working in email marketing (where I learned some HTML) and enjoyed it, so I wanted to learn more. &nbsp;If you're like me&nbsp;and can't pay attention in a physical class, Thinkful's online bootcamp is great. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Flexible course is paced so that you can go at your own speed, and it provides relevant examples along the course as you learn, so it's not just pure text reading. &nbsp;You do need to be willing to dedicate and put it in the time and&nbsp;effort into going through the material and practices/projects when you're by yourself, but having a mentor work with you 1 on 1 is amazing and helps you through it when you're stuck or just have questions. &nbsp;Also, special shoutout to Capi for being awesome and patient with me through the entire course!</p>\n\n<p>There are also a lot of sessions that you can join throughout the week to ask questions from other mentors, and I highly recommend taking advantage of&nbsp;those. &nbsp;Sometimes even if you don't have a question, you can pick up some stuff from other students asking questions.</p>\n\n<p>I finished the course in about 6 months after portfolio reviews and started working with Career Services. &nbsp;Thinkful does guarantee a job after the course, however&nbsp;they're not going to just give one to you. &nbsp;You need to put in the work in searching, applying, and interviewing, but they make sure to help you through the entire process. &nbsp;Resume and portfolio reviews, interview practice,&nbsp;suggestions/resources on whiteboarding, and a Career Services&nbsp;mentor&nbsp;are all part of the package. Also, a special shoutout to Rob for always taking the time to meet&nbsp;and pep-talk me before my interviews! &nbsp;Thinkful Slack is&nbsp;helpful during this process in the careers chat too. &nbsp;You can get tips from the people in Career Services there or from other students. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Learning web development in a short time isn't easy, but I feel that Thinkful does a great job in getting you skilled and ready. &nbsp;Two months after I finished the course, I got a contract as a junior front end web developer, and I'm making more than I used to doing something I enjoy a lot more.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/8152/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">13</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20I%20got%20a%20job%21%20%7C%20id%3A%208152\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/8004\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_8004\" id=\"review_8004\">Invaluable Learning Experience</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">4/24/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Pat </span><span> • Web Developer </span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Invaluable Learning Experience</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>A summing up of my experience with the Front-End Developer track:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Wonderful curriculum rich with information that is otherwise hard to find</li>\n\t<li>Curriculum is meaningful, fun, and fast-paced.

I'm now 2 weeks into the job search.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Background:</p>\n\n<p>I joined Thinkful&nbsp;after an 18 month stint in the banking industry in NYC. That was my first job after graduating college. Prior to taking the course, I took a 4 week bootcamp&nbsp;prep course offered by another bootcamp institution. &nbsp;In addition, I completed the Javascript track on Codecademy. Other than that, I had never been exposed to programming in any meaningful way.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overall Experience:</p>\n\n<p>I could not be more happy with my experience at Thinkful. Thinkful provides a comprehensive suite of services to their students from day 1&nbsp;to the day you land your first job (and beyond). The instructors, the TAs, the mentors, the program director and the career services advisers share one common trait: they care deeply about your success. This is what drives the entire process at Thinkful&nbsp;and it's what makes their program stand out from the rest.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Instructors:</p>\n\n<p>The instructors at Thinkful&nbsp;are top notch. They are tremendously knowledgeable and passionate about what they do. Joe and Ben were extremely responsive to our questions and they were always willing to clarify and expand&nbsp;on topics when necessary. The TA's (who join the class for several hours every day) were excellent at explaining difficult topics, guiding students through bugs, and suggesting improvements to code. Every weeknight, students meet 1 on 1 with Mentors who are there to answer&nbsp;questions related to coding, technology, languages, frameworks, jobs etc. I looked forward to my meetings with my Mentor every single day. Finally, Thinkful&nbsp;offers several live Q&amp;A sessions every evening where subject matter experts are on hand to answer questions related to all things programming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Curriculum:</p>\n\n<p>The skills taught at Thinkful are highly relevant in the job market today. The primary stack is MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. This seems to be the most commonly desired stack among employers in early 2017. I feel like I'm well-prepared to contribute to a development team. With that said, the curriculum at Thinkful is very flexible. When technologies change, Thinkful&nbsp;adjusts quickly. Furthermore, Thinkful&nbsp;also reserves the right to make adjustments to the curriculum on a daily basis in order to address difficulties that the class might be having as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Job Assistance:</p>\n\n<p>I am still early in the job search process, but Thinkful has been very helpful so far. They take it upon themselves to connect you with employers. Not only that, but they provide you with resources such as career coaching, interview prep, portfolio review, resume editing and more. Even though I \"graduated\" a few weeks ago, I feel like Thinkful is as involved as ever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/7914/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">9</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Full%20Stack%20Web%20Development%20Bootcamp%20Review%20%28December%20Cohort%29%20%7C%20id%3A%207914\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Full Time Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/7733\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_7733\" id=\"review_7733\">Solid program</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">4/11/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Hannah </span><span></span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Full Time Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Solid program</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I recently finished the full-time web dev bootcamp. Highlights: strong course material, helpful online community, and lots of in-depth, student-driven projects that I had a lot of fun with — and they look great in a portfolio. Lows: Mentors are hit or miss, and the daily in-person lectures are often just repetition of the course material and also are limited by the online format, so they're not super engaging or interactive. The lectures in particular are a casualty of the online format, but overall, if you're looking specifically for a remote bootcamp, I'd recommend Thinkful.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/7733/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">8</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Solid%20program%20%7C%20id%3A%207733\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/7696\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_7696\" id=\"review_7696\">Impressive </a></div><div class=\"review-date\">4/9/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">I'm DZ </span><span> • Student  </span><span></span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Impressive </span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I&nbsp;have switched 3 mentors, and it's a common situation. If you could be assigned&nbsp;&nbsp;a mentor who is responsible, willing to help you, lead you, I'd say you are super lucky.</p>\n\n<p>My second mentor spent 2 whole sessions to debug a typo, refused to take a look at my code, and told me that was not his responsibility to take a look at students' code :) Funny</p>\n\n<p>My third mentor was much smarter than the last one, however he ignored my messages for most of the time, when you get stuck and nobody could help you out, the feeling is fantastic:)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Then I started my career service. They have this strict rule says if students don't show up in the session for twice, they will lose the 6- month job guarantee. So be careful and read the email once the career service send to you , don't act like me chose to take it as an automatically assigning email and ignore it, because nobody will tell you that unless you break the rules.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The funniest thing was, my career coach&nbsp;forgot to send me invitations which include session link and time each week( they have the rule that mentors and coaches have to send out invitations each week to remind students). And I totally forgot about our meetings because I have a very small brain :). Although I was sitting in the front of computer thinking about my life, and one single slack message could remind me of this meeting, however my career coach chose not to, instead sending me very caring and considering&nbsp;&nbsp;emails 3 hrs later after the sessions were over, told me I lost my job guarantee. Here is the funniest part, I explained to career service manager and my program manager that my coach never sent me the invitations, and she suddenly realized she made this mistake and changed the date information of my first agreed invitation, screenshot to the managers. So now I'm not only a irresponsible person but also a lair :). I cried for whole day, and explained everything to my program manager, I asked the receipt emails of agreed invitations to prove myself, he ignored me, and after I was reassigned a new career coach, the last one started sending out the invitations LOL. Such a unforgettable experience. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overall, you are on your own for 90% of time and efforts, so work extremely hard.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/7696/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">14</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Impressive%20%20%7C%20id%3A%207696\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div></div>",

This course is really suited my style of learning. I first wanted to learn the Front end portion (HTML/CSS/JS..APIs) and see how I perform before taking a bigger leap forward and get the Backend dev knowledge. Thinkful program really helped me to make that choice and i am definetely going to move forward and learn the backend portion of it too. My mentor Sara, was really great..we had a really friendly relation and she was always there whenever I had any concerns. Generally, I use to write down my concerns and send it to her prior to our weekly sessions so that she can review them.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, this course was great and if you are looking to learn some good stuff!

So I thought it would be beneficial to me in my field. I chose the Web Development online course. The chat board is always busy full of helpful people and often mentors too. Since I chose the frontend web developement course I had a mentor once a week. This part was a little shaky for me but Thinkful made it all better. I had one mentor for a while I really liked but had to leave one personal reasons and &nbsp;then one I was not working well with. So I emailed my thoughts and what I was looking in a mentor to thinkful and they set me up with a wonderful, mentor exactly who I was looking for to excel in the course and in my field. Like all the bootcamp style courses, you truly get what you put in. but this one was there for all the hard times. And when you finish you get to stay in the slack channel, and be able to review the course work, which you can modify or leaveas is for your protfolio.</p>\n\n<p>It was a was a good experience and one I am glad I took.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/7076/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">7</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20great%20experience%20with%20lots%20of%20help%20%7C%20id%3A%207076\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"User Experience Design\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/6857\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_6857\" id=\"review_6857\">Thinkful - great practical learning experience!</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">2/10/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Nina </span><span></span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: User Experience Design </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Thinkful - great practical learning experience!</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>As I wanted to switch my career from Marketing to UX design, I decided to take on the UX design course at Thinkful. It was a great experience, with a great curriculum.The weekly 1 to 1's with your personal mentor are really helpful, as you discuss your coursework and you get an industry professionals feedback and insights about your work. The online course itself is also good, exercises are fun and insightful. Thinkful's UX design course is great because you also work on a couple of projects which you can actually use for your portfolio, which is one of the main reasons why I decided to go with Thinkful. Additionally, I thought the 'student service' was great: If you have any questions about payment, curriculum or anything else, they are quick to reply and help you the best they can. All in all a great learning experience!</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/6857/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">9</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Thinkful%20-%20great%20practical%20learning%20experience%21%20%7C%20id%3A%206857\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Web Development in Rails\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/6770\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_6770\" id=\"review_6770\">Web Development in Rails 10/10</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">2/2/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Thomas Riley </span><span></span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Web Development in Rails </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Web Development in Rails 10/10</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I was hesitant about online learning before I started my courses with Thinkful.

My first mentor call was challenging, at first she asked me questions to get to know me better and once I told her where I was from. She then took up the majority of the call telling me about how she lived in the same state and all the places she visited and aswesome things she did. At first it was nice but then she never moved on. I'm a school teacher and learn quickly but the course material was not user friendly. I noted to my mentor on my second call how words were mispelled on the weekly lessons&nbsp;and all they provided was steps and did not explain the purpose on why the material was provided. It was like insert code here, insert code in this other area but you never knew the reasoning behind it. My mentor again dominated the call with her weekend and didn't seem to want to discuss my coding fears. She advised that she was teaching a course at a college and was only the night before trying to get a lesson together. I was like huh?!?&nbsp;After the third call and her dominating the conversation with trivial facts, it was like we spent the entire call talking about her and she had the worse internet signal. In the end, I was paying for the course and she wasn't helpful at all so&nbsp;I requested another mentor. The second mentor was awesome and explained the lessons&nbsp;way better but still the course material that we worked on weekly did not provide any helpful instructions. I shouldn't have to wait until my phone call to get clarification. My mentor was great but I ended up leaving the program. I felt it was more of a code cash meal. I work in education and know when something has been poorly created and executed. I have a MS in Instructional Design and technology and create core content. They really need to retool the outdated resources on their website and at least provide instruction. Telling someone to go find the answer on the internet without even providing an explanation makes no sense. How about you give me a plausible solution and tell me to check the internet if I need further clarification. If you need a program that's gonna start ground up and build, this is not the program but if you have a&nbsp;basic coding background, this may work for you. I did not get to the job assistance art&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/6688/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">37</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Smoke%20and%20Mirrors%20%20%7C%20id%3A%206688\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"User Experience Design\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/6392\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_6392\" id=\"review_6392\">Excellent UX Design course!</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">1/6/2017</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Matthew W. </span><span></span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: User Experience Design </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Excellent UX Design course!</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I had a great experience with my mentor, Alissa Pierce, and the UX Thinkful Course. &nbsp;I took this course to refresh some of the traditional education I received a while back, to brush the dust off my UX training.

I had more coding experience, I think, than many students coming in, which allowed me to sail through early lessons very quickly. Within a couple weeks, though, I was learning lots of new stuff. The curriculum is good, but there are other good curricula out there, often cheaper. The real game-changers for me were two things:<br>\n<br>\n1)&nbsp;The capstone projects (you'll do three of them in the bootcamp), where you come up with your own independent ideas outside the curriculum and build it. These become portfolio pieces that you can be proud of, and show off to prospective employers. It makes a huge&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n2) The mentors. My mentor, TJ, has been amazing. In addition to just helping me understand issues I struggle with, and helping me get back on track when I get stuck, it's also a big help to have someone to hold me accountable for working every day. He has also become a friend over time. This one-on-one attention helps Thinkful escape the problems with many other online programs, that you're on your own and can easily run out of steam or motivation alone. There's also a Slack (group chat) team, where you can engage with other students and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;All mentors are not equal, though, and because the system is so dependent on that one-on-one attention, the experience could be very different with a different mentor. Keep in mind that you can request a new mentor at any time and for any reason, if the one you're originally assigned to doesn't meet your expectations. I recommend that new students take advantage of this option, until you find the mentor who's right for you.<br>\n<br>\nAnother aspect that was a deciding factor for me was Thinkful's job guarantee. They have a 94% placement rate for graduates into full-time jobs in their field of study. That's pretty impressive! Though not 100%, it's high enough that Thinkful is willing to refund your money, if you're in the 6% that don't find jobs in the end, so it's low-risk. The program will quickly pay for itself if you do find a full-time web developer job, of course, as it's a well-paid field. That 93% is for students who graduate within the expected 6 months, who find a full-time job in the field within 6 months after graduating. I've had an initial meeting with one of Thinkful's career counselors, soon after starting the program, and they gave me some good advice for moving forward. I can't really evaluate that part of the program yet, though, as I haven't gotten to the point where that's a primary focus, or seriously started looking for a job.<br>\n<br>\nA couple caveats about the job guarantee: it applies only if you complete the course within 6 months, and if you live in an area where tech jobs are available. If you mention the job guarantee in your initial meeting to talk about Thinkful (which you can do for free, and without commitment), they'll explain this to you and tell you whether your area qualifies, but I think most metro areas are good. If you live out in the sticks, don't count on their guarantee. The trickier part is graduating within 6 months. I noticed that their graduation rates are considerably lower than their job placement rates (among graduates.) If you do graduate, but not within 6 months, you're still pretty likely to find a job but they won't guarantee it. And if that's an important aspect to you, plan on treating the expected 20-25 hours per week as a bare minimum, and going well beyond it whenever you can.<br>\n<br>\nAfter spending a couple months in this program, I highly recommend it.

Also, I was a bit skeptical about the quality and efficiency of the program since it was online.</p>\n\n<p>After 4 months of being a&nbsp;Thinkful&nbsp;student in the part-time web development&nbsp;bootcamp,&nbsp;I can say that this program has gone well beyond my expectations. The following are some highlights of my experience and why I would recommend Thinkful:</p>\n\n<p>- Mentorship: This has been the most important aspect of my learning experience in the program. My mentor,&nbsp;Sebastian Bastidas, is amazing! He is an excellent teacher and a great web developer with lots of experience. He always goes the extra mile to help me, making sure that I understand the concepts covered in the curriculum, and motivate me to be better at coding. I always look forward to our meetings because I learn a lot in every single one of them!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Since mentorship is such a crucial component of this program, it is great that Thinkful&nbsp;gives you the option to change your mentor if you're not satisfied with their way of teaching. This was great for me because when I started Thinkful, I wasn't very happy with my first mentor (he was very informal and would cancel sessions often) and was re-assigned to my current mentor without problems and was compensated for the sessions that I missed. I am really glad that I changed my mentor because my experience wouldn't have been the same if I had stayed with my first mentor.</p>\n\n<p>- Curriculum: Thinkful's curriculum is well structured and very relevant to the current job market. I know this first hand because my husband and&nbsp;friends work in the tech industry and&nbsp;use many of the technologies covered in this course. Furthermore, during the 4 months that I have been in the program, they have updated several parts of the curriculum to make sure that it is up to date with the industry's latest&nbsp;standards.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, sometimes the notes and exercises are not very thorough or clear. However, my mentor has always taken the time to explain these to me more thoroughly &nbsp;(on our meetings and Slack) and provide&nbsp;me with additional resources when needed. Furthermore, the Slack channel and the question and answer sessions are also very helpful to clarify any issues with the materials. During my 4 months in this program, I have never felt alone in my learning experience and have always gotten help when I get stuck.</p>\n\n<p>- Staff: Thinkful's staff members have been very helpful even since before I started the program. They are very friendly, easy to reach, and resolve issues quickly.</p>\n\n<p>- Job assistance: I haven't finished the program yet, therefore, I cannot fully evaluate how good is the job assistance. Nevertheless, the mock interviews are very good practice and it is also great to be building a job-ready portfolio during the program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>- Flexibility: The program's flexibility has been great for me since I work part-time. Also, I was able to pause the program for a month while I went on a holiday overseas. During the time I was on pause, &nbsp;it was great to have access to the curriculum, Q+A, and workshops.</p>\n\n<p>These are the reasons why I would recommend Thinkful's part-time web development bootcamp. Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize that this has been my experience after 4 months in the program and I still have two more months to go. I know from people that have completed other web development&nbsp;bootcamps that they can truly evaluate the quality of the bootcamp months after they finish. Therefore, I will write another review when I finish in order to provide a more accurate evaluation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/6279/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">11</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Excellent%20experience%20%7C%20id%3A%206279\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/6228\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_6228\" id=\"review_6228\">Bootcamp Review</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">12/21/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Bernadette Kelly </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Bootcamp Review</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>My first few weeks with Thinkful have been very fulfilling.

With only about a month of coding experience, only about 20 hours to spare a week with coding after working and&nbsp;a four month old baby girl, you can say I needed a pretty flexible program to meet my needs. I also wanted a program that would intentionally invest in me as a student&nbsp;and not just stick a video or book&nbsp;in front of my face and expect me to learn. I was for sure that intentionality and an online program wouldn't mix, until I came across Thinkful. Thinkful uses a mentor-mentee model that capitalizes on some of the perks of being in person and learning, and combines it with the flexiblity of learning online at your pace. I'm about a month in, and I've seen my mentor over a dozen times through&nbsp;live video chat and numerous other program mentors (Program Mentors and Career Mentors). My mentor,&nbsp;<span>Aleksandar Grbic, has been incredible. From working with my crazy schedule to being available for me at a moments notice. Not once have I felt like I'm alone on this journey. The resources Thinkful and Aleks have provided me with have been above and beyond to make sure I succeed. No program is perfect, but this is about as close as you'll come to finding an intentional, flexible, and resource packed program to make sure you get a job.</span></p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5985/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">9</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Flexible%20Web%20Development%20Review%20%7C%20id%3A%205985\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5969\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5969\" id=\"review_5969\">Flexiable Web Bootcamp</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">12/7/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Edgar M </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Flexiable Web Bootcamp</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I couldn't be more happy with the experience that I am having with this course. Being that I am in a situation where I need&nbsp;to keep my current job because of&nbsp;financial obligations and a limited budget, Thinkful flex-bootcamp was the exact solution that I was looking for. By face value, Thinkful flex-bootcamp seemed too good to be true, especially with their job placement gaurantee. But with the tools and their community helped me to be 4 weeks ahead of schedule.&nbsp;Please don't get me wrong, the course work itself is very demanding of my time and with having a full-time job does not make it easy. It requires a lot of drive, dedication, and self motivation to learn a large amount of information in a short time frame. Thinkful does help in guiding you and motivating you through the course work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thinkfuls course does a good job taking you step by step, from the basics to more advanced skills, in a orderly and reasonable fasion. I am a huge advocate for the project based learning which Thinkful is all about. They have you learn by making projects and using tools that are very common for programmers to use. When you get stuck on an issue they have a slack channel, Q&amp;A sessions, workshops, and personnel&nbsp;mentorship.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think the gold nugget of this program is having the personnel mentor sessions to help you with the exact problems that you are having with your project. My mentor has helped me through many issues, especially with the larger concepts. We spend however long we would like on one issue, or cover mutiple issues. Basically whatever you need to cover I know I have my mentor to clarify my issues with my project and get feedback from my work. And if I need help with an issue right away they have their slack channel that has a community of mentors ready to help you out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I am very happy so far with what I have experience in this flex-bootcamp. The course work and community help is great. I am currently on the backend course work of Node.js and hopefully start my fullstack project soon. I cannot say anything about their job placement program yet but maybe when the time comes I can update you all on that part of the program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I recommend this program for people who are in my situation financially and professionally. But please be prepared to dedicate a lot of time outside of work (including weekends) if you want to graduate within the 6 month time frame for the flex-bootcamp. There is a lot of material that needs to be covered and a lot of research and readings that are required. If you are highly motivated to learn the material then you should be in good shape in taking this course.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5969/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">6</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Flexiable%20Web%20Bootcamp%20%7C%20id%3A%205969\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5899\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5899\" id=\"review_5899\">Not just for n00bs</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">11/30/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Gene M.

I dabbled in very (VERY!) basic HTML before coming to Thinkful but after almost 2 months of doing the Front End Web Dev course, I feel much more confident in my HTML/CSS skills.</p>\n\n<p>My mentor, Morgan, has been extremely helpful in our sessions. What I most appreciate about his approach is the time he takes to clean up my code. Especially at the beginning I would \"finish\" my assignments (in that everything looked up to specs) but my code was messy or the solutions implemented were fragile and unreliable. Morgan is able to carefully tread that line between approving my solution but also helping me understand why a different approach could have been better, and making sure that I understand what clean code looks like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I have been extremely impressed with Thinkful. I will likely take more courses (.AngularJS and Front End on Rails) once I finish Front End Web Dev. Keep up the good work, Thinkful!</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5817/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">2</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Excellent%20Launching%20Pad%20%7C%20id%3A%205817\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5712\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5712\" id=\"review_5712\">Best learning experience</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">11/16/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Alina V. </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Best learning experience</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>Thinkful is totally worth your&nbsp;time and money. It is the most efficient and professionally designed online course that I've participated in. I would highlight several differentiating points:</p>\n\n<p>1) 1-1 mentorship makes a big difference. I have a fantastic mentor Victor who helps me not only with code, but also advises on&nbsp;many latest industry tips and tools. Having a good mentor makes&nbsp;50% of your success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2) Good structure and course design. This bootcamp gives you very close to reality tasks and you can always review them with your mentor. No need&nbsp;to follow strict solutions by the textbook - you can always be creative and invent something on your own and test it.</p>\n\n<p>3) Mock interviews. That's another great thing about Thinkful - you can always practice how it will feel like in the real interviews and understand what are your strong points and what things you can improve. Now I have better understanding about job market and what people would look for in hiring process.</p>\n\n<p>4) Support and&nbsp;community. I just can't describe how responsive, flexible and open everybody is here.&nbsp;Program manager Derek, Ariana and Noel from support team - everybody can answer my questions or even adjust my schedule anytime.&nbsp;And also student community can be very helpful to ask questions and to keep motivation high.</p>\n\n<p>5) Flexibility and smooth career transition. For me it was extremely important to have access to the course from any place in the world&nbsp;without sacrificing my full-time job. I don't know other bootcamps that can offer such flexibility.</p>\n\n<p>After struggling with self-study coding courses Thinkful became a true breakthrough and made me believe that I can build things and find answers on my own. It's worth it!</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5712/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">5</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Best%20learning%20experience%20%7C%20id%3A%205712\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"User Experience Design\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5680\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5680\" id=\"review_5680\">Wonderful Program with One-on-one Mentoring</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">11/14/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Jasmine A. </span><span></span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: User Experience Design </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Wonderful Program with One-on-one Mentoring</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I did a lot of research when it came to looking to a UX Design course. I was looking for a program that would offer hands-on projects and mentoring. I got both of those with Thinkful's UX Design course. The way the course was set-up was very organized and straightforward. There was a lot of reading materials which were very relevant and intersting. My mentor was absolutely amazing. Initially, I was a little worried about doing a course and getting placed with a mentor. However, they matched me so well with my mentor. She had a lot of experience, was passionate, and made a career switch as I was planning to do. Overall, this course has prepared me to use the skills I gained and to further practice. I would have loved to spend even more time in the course and soak up information. I know the course will get better and better as time goes on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5680/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">4</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Wonderful%20Program%20with%20One-on-one%20Mentoring%20%7C%20id%3A%205680\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Full Time Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5470\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5470\" id=\"review_5470\">Excellent Value, Excellent Program</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">10/27/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">JP </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Full Time Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Excellent Value, Excellent Program</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I'm currently a student in Thinkful's full-time web development bootcamp.

I tried the Python tutorial, a book that used C++, and various other free resources, but none of them got everything right and I was left stranded. When I found out how Thinkful teaches their students, including the mentor system, I knew I could use their support network to finally get into programming. While I am only about a month into the course, I can already say that I am a programmer (albeit still learning, but really we all are). My mentor has just the right balance of showing me what I need to do while letting me find some problems for myself. The course curriculum is pretty good at teaching the details of what I need to work with without being overwhelming (though I do have to take a break if I read too much in one sitting). Between mentor sessions I have found the Slack team very helpful for getting me unstuck.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5354/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">3</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Excellent%20at%20accelerating%20learning%20%7C%20id%3A%205354\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5343\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5343\" id=\"review_5343\">Amazing Learning Experience.</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">10/18/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Camillo </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Amazing Learning Experience.</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>Being enrolled for almost one month at Thinkful Flexible Web Development bootcamp, and so far, I can say that I had the greatest (and toughest) learning experience in my life!</p>\n\n<p>The dream to dig into the \"Coding_World\" finally came true, and the reason I chose to enrol at Thinkful was for the great Curriculum they offer on the Web Development bootcamp; looking at the \"real World\" requirements, I believe their Curriculum is a great match.</p>\n\n<p>The learning-path has been fantastic, in one month I went from a novice level to feel completely comfortable in subject such as HTML/CSS/Git/JavaScript (working on it)....said that, the path itself is not an easy one, it requires quite a lot of dedication, passion, curiosity...not everything is \"given\" lots of resources have to be found from the student, and as much it may seem \"difficult\", it is a great learning skill that will be easily (and for sure) applied in a working-environment...bottom line, skills like problem-solving, or going the \"extra-mile\" are extremely appreciated by potential employer.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking about the learning path, I found extremely useful interact (3x week) with my mentor (Akiva) ... I think the mentor is the greatest integration to the material, being able to give direction, to highlight concepts in a different way, and to advice on the points where to focus.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, I am really happy about my experience at Thinkful; I feel that the hard coding-hours have being rewarded with learning results....solving and understanding hard-topics, build confidence...and confidence gives energy to learn more and more.&nbsp; Bottom line, my Program Manager told me the first day \"...<em>do not be afraid of hard moment, think at how is rewarding solving them!.</em>..\" - I completely agree.</p>\n\n<p>Main reasons for my great experience at Thinkful:</p>\n\n<p>- Curriculum</p>\n\n<p>- Mentorship</p>\n\n<p>- Projects</p>\n\n<p>- feeling to be ready for a \"real\" Working environment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5343/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">1</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Amazing%20Learning%20Experience.%20%7C%20id%3A%205343\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5333\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5333\" id=\"review_5333\">Very Good Course</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">10/17/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Eugene Park </span><span> • UI Developer-ish </span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Very Good Course</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I've taken a few free online courses to learn web development so paying for a curriculum was a bit of a leap for me.

From Noel who answered all my questions as I was comparing bootcamps to Derek who took me through the orientation session and my mentor Eric who has been a huge help answering my unending questions, I can't imagine having a better experience so far.</p>\n\n<p>I initially started learning to code on my own, and liked it so much I knew I wanted to make it into a full time career.&nbsp;Thinkful was miles ahead of the competition because they contacted me directly within minutes of submitting the interest form, and they always reached out to me to see how the decision process&nbsp;was going. It was a personal, welcoming&nbsp;experience from the very start and everyone I spoke with was passionate about helping a noob coder find their way.</p>\n\n<p>The curriculum is&nbsp;great. It's well written and the assignments/projects are practical,&nbsp;useful and sometimes humorous which really helps keep things interesting. The goals are realistic as is the usage of the knowledge gained. The minimum amount of hours necessary to complete the bootcamp is very doable as I work full time and never struggle&nbsp;to make time for the course.</p>\n\n<p>My mentor has been fantastic as well. It's easy to get frustrated&nbsp;when you hit a roadblock but having your mentor there to guide you is invaluable. They've faced the same challenges and can bring a new perspective to your struggle, or give you an explanation of your mistake so you never make the same mistake twice.&nbsp;Hearing from an experienced web developer&nbsp;how the knowledge from the curriculum applies to their every day life&nbsp;is a huge bonus.&nbsp;The frequent&nbsp;Q&amp;A sessions are also very useful - there is no lack of resources with Thinkful.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't reached the career part, so I can't give that a review yet. However, I have already had a meeting with a member of the Career Services team who gave me tons of resources to look at to narrow down where I'd like to work/what I'm looking for. I'm fully confident that when the curriculum is complete, I'll achieve my goals with the help of the Thinkful&nbsp;team.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5161/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">3</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Best%20of%20the%20Best%20%7C%20id%3A%205161\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5154\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5154\" id=\"review_5154\">Great Flexible Bootcamp</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">10/4/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Vic </span><span> • IT support </span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Great Flexible Bootcamp</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I would highly recommend Thinkful's Flexible Web Development Bootcamp for the following reasons:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>1. The flexible schedule works extremely well for me. I work 30 hours a week and &nbsp;have a family to take of. It would be really difficult to keep up with a full-time or even part-time boot camp. I put in about 15 hours a week and so far it has been a very fulfilling learning experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>2. Since the day I started, Thinkful's staff members have been in constant communication with me. I don't always have to initiate to get a response, which is a really nice change from traditional education institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3. My mentor is extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and flexible with his time as well. He understands that I have other commitments outside of the course and is always willing to work with me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>4. I started the bootcamp without any experience, but Thinkful's curriculum and support never made me feel inadequate. I am currently four months in and coding is already a part of my daily life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>5. I have not gotten to the job assistance part, so I can't give it a full rating. But my career mentor has already reached out to me and the mock interviews are definitely helpful. I feel like this program is designed to land students a job. That is my top priority and I am very satisfied with my progress so far.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5154/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">4</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Great%20Flexible%20Bootcamp%20%7C%20id%3A%205154\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5142\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5142\" id=\"review_5142\">A truly great way to learn front end</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">10/3/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Kelsey Jacobsen </span><span> • Product Designer </span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">A truly great way to learn front end</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>My experience with Thinkful has been a great one! I signed up to take the Front End Web Development course after trying several times to learn HTML, CSS, jQuery and&nbsp;Javascript both on my own and in other online courses, with all attempts ending&nbsp;unsuccessfully. Thinkful's curriculum and mentor program are the reason their course works so well. The material builds slowly upon itself, so it lays a solid foundation of understanding that then applies to later lessons, concepts, and languages learned. Having a mentor to talk directly to about any questions I had or concepts I found confusing made all the difference in the world. My mentor, Max, was awesome! He was always there to answer any questions and would often walk me through other exercises or examples that helped me see the problem I was stuck on in a different way, therefore unblocking me. I cannot speak highly enough of this program!</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5142/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">2</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20A%20truly%20great%20way%20to%20learn%20front%20end%20%7C%20id%3A%205142\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Programming in Python\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5089\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5089\" id=\"review_5089\">Great Format</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">9/27/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Bernardo </span><span> • Sr. Analyst </span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Programming in Python </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Great Format</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I really enjoyed the experience at Thinkful. I've been learning Python with various platforms and found that the structure of Thinkful sets it apart from the rest. Being higher priced than others allows the program to provide more human interaction. My mentor was instrumental in my success and I took part in some Q&amp;A sessions and the Slack channel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>My one critique would be that I thought the pace was a bit fast for a class being advertised as beginner. I think some of the course content could be expanded upon before getting into building the programs. I would recommend having some foundations in Python before taking this class. I am interested in continuing my training in the Data Science class that Thinkful offers so I would say that is a testement to their offerings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5089/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">2</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Great%20Format%20%7C%20id%3A%205089\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5057\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5057\" id=\"review_5057\"> Two months so far with Thinkful</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">9/23/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Trey  </span><span> • Jazz Musician/construction </span><span></span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\"> Two months so far with Thinkful</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>With only a few months of coding experience prior to enrolling into the Thinkful part-time flexible career path, I have so far managed to finish all of my project assignments on time&nbsp;and conveniently attend&nbsp;mentor sessions. Before enrolling, my biggest concern was falling behind due to my lack of prior coding experience and/or basic understanding of code and web related stuff. I was a total noob when it came to computers, and so I naturally felt that enrolling into a bootcamp might not be a practical idea considering how rigorous and intensive most bootcamps are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thinkful stands out from other bootcamps in that it offers various courses to accomodate its students. At age 29, I chose to enroll into the flexible part-time career path since I couldn't quit my current job. This&nbsp;isn't an&nbsp;option with other bootcamps, such as Hackreactor, a school in which I&nbsp;originally wanted to enroll. Thinkful offers same results as other schools, but different approaches.</p>\n\n<p>The Thinkful team has worked with me in many ways than just teaching me to code. The&nbsp;Q&amp;A sessions that are offered,&nbsp;along with forums and Slack discussions,&nbsp;have helped&nbsp;immerse me&nbsp;in not only the langauge&nbsp;but the entire&nbsp;culture of code, an experience&nbsp;I couldn't have achieved with&nbsp;doing personal research alone.&nbsp;Like any language, to be fluent one must understand the abstract things that underlie&nbsp;grammar,&nbsp;syntax, and even pronunciation, and the abstract part of code, to me, is understanding the various styles&nbsp;code. There are so many ways to write code, and once you understand basic syntax and logic, the fun part is finding your style.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thinkful also does a great job at&nbsp;emphasizing&nbsp;the importance in honing your research skills as a&nbsp;developer.&nbsp;Various online resources are provided, perfect for bookmarking so&nbsp;to&nbsp;revisit&nbsp;or harken back to later if&nbsp;needed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you're pretty serious about learning to code, I highly recommend doing so via the Thinkful team. I am 2 months in and already I feel I am starting to see the world from the eyes of a developer, and develop my own unique \"style\" of writing code. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/5057/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">8</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20%20Two%20months%20so%20far%20with%20Thinkful%20%7C%20id%3A%205057\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/5018\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_5018\" id=\"review_5018\">Great experience</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">9/20/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Olia </span><span></span><span> • Graduate </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Great experience</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>Thinkful Front-end Development course proved to me that I can actually code which seemed almost impossible before!

I've tried a couple of courses from different companies, but I feel like the one that helped me the most was Thinkful. The way they provide the information is very useful. They will give you a task and a one hour time frame for you to complete as much as you can. Once you finish the one hour time frame, you can go to the next step which is a walkthrough of how to complete the previous task.<br>\n<br>\nThe 1on1 with the mentor is such a great way to answer all your questions. Nicolas was my mentor and I have to say that he was an awesome resource that helped me a lot. I would recommend Thinkful to anyone who wants to learn how to code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/4883/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">4</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Thinkful%20review.%20%7C%20id%3A%204883\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Flexible Web Development Bootcamp\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/4857\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_4857\" id=\"review_4857\">Worth it</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">9/7/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Brian Barrow </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Flexible Web Development Bootcamp </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Worth it</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-empty_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I have really enjoyed the Thinkful curriculum so far.

I don't have a background in coding but do have a sense of curiosity and desire to learn so I was searching for a program that would support me as I learnt concepts that we new to me. &nbsp;Part of the beauty of this program is the personal support provided by the staff. I'm not searching for tradtional employment upon gradution but rather the start of a freelance career so it's been great to hear from the various support staff as to how they can help me achieve this. &nbsp;I've never felt like a generic student being pushed through the program but rather like an individual with specfic needs that can be discussed and addressed. &nbsp;I have 3 people in my support team: my mentor, my program manager and a career counselor. We have discussed how my experience can be tailored to help my needs, from changing out sections of the curiculum to altering my career search to match the requirements of being a freelancer. &nbsp;It makes me fee like I'm being set up to succeed and flourish with my new found skills.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of coursework support, I have 3 online video sessions with my mentor where we talk through concepts I'm having trouble grasping or work through code that isn't working. &nbsp;If I'm between sessions there is plenty of support in the form of online office hours or a slack channel filled with people happy to help.</p>\n\n<p>If you are worried about coding being too hard for you or feeling like you want support and motivation as you learn then I can't recommend thinkful.com enough.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/4754/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">2</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20amazing%20personalised%20support.%20%7C%20id%3A%204754\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/4727\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_4727\" id=\"review_4727\">Very worthwhile course</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">8/26/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Michelle Litzau </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Very worthwhile course</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I am currently in the Front End Web Development course and I am getting a lot out of it.

and here's my experience so far.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It took me a while to finally commit to thinkful,&nbsp;a lot of research and asking around. a lot of other school out there offeres the same or if not almost the same curiculum as thiknkful. but what actually caught my attention was their promise to land you or at least help you land a job. and since i'm doing this to change careers these option works best for me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I started with a call with NOEL your friendly thinkful walking wikipedia who i think knows everything you need to know about thinkful.&nbsp;after he answered all my questions i know i'm in. he sent me the link to the enrollment page</p>\n\n<p>Note: one thing i love about thinkful is they offer a a lot of payment options. which really really help. they're working with skill funds for any one who needs to take a loan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>after i enrolled, i got scheduled with Aric my program manager who walked me through on how the course will be. he was staright out on what to exoect from them and what they expect from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>after that i had my first mentor interview scheduled, which i think cause my mentor flaked on me, but i'm pretty sure he has a valid reason. i sent an email out to aric and the thinkful support team, they responded pretty quick. i got a little late with my mentor sessions but it's ok cause they provided me with a new mentor Kris Craw who is by the way an amazing mentor. his style in teaching works prefect for me. i don't know about other mentor but this guy is the best, he actually gives a lot of pro-tips which helps a lot in moving forward, his tips&nbsp;makes your coding life more easier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>i'm currenty doing the JQuery lessons and so far everything has been great.</p>\n\n<p>this course like every other course really depends on how your outlook is. if you're willing to learn you will learn a lot of new amazing things.&nbsp;what i really suggest to anyone planning to enroll is try out codecademy free material&nbsp;its not 100%&nbsp;the same but i think its the closest you can get on how their material feels like, this is a good way to see if you can commit into an on-line coding class. cause it's not easy you need dedication.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>one last thing i want to add. i think what makes thinkful really stand-out than others are their mentor sessions, this helps a lot specially in understanding the lessons. or giving you tips.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/4499/votes\">This Review Is

Naively, I jumped at the chance, thinking app development couldn't be&nbsp;hard. But it's tough, crazy tough for a beginner like me.&nbsp;There are many online tutorials, many of which don't cost much. And maybe you won't consider this until you've been as far as I have in the tutorial wilderness. The mentorship at Thinkful is really great along with the slack channel where you can get even more help in between sessions.&nbsp;The user experience of the course is also really great. Some courses have&nbsp;smallish font with scattered videos. Thinkful is a nice clean presentation that makes you feel comfortable with learning and keeps you going.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/4496/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">3</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20I%27ve%20tried%20a%20few%2C%20Thinkful%20is%20the%20best%20%7C%20id%3A%204496\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"review\" data-campus=\"Online (Thinkful)\" data-course=\"Frontend Web Development\"><div><div class=\"review-school hidden\"><span>Thinkful</span><a href=\"https://www.thinkful.com/a/coursereport\"></a></div><div class=\"review-title\"><a class=\"title\" data-deeplink-path=\"/reviews/review/4397\" data-deeplink-target=\"#review_4397\" id=\"review_4397\">Great Course</a></div><div class=\"review-date\">7/28/2016</div><div class=\"reviewer-details\"><span class=\"reviewer-name\">Joseph </span><span></span><span> • Student </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Course: Frontend Web Development </span><span class=\"hidden-xs\"> •  Campus: Online </span></div><div class=\"ratings\"><span class=\"hidden\">Great Course</span><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Overall Experience:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Curriculum:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-4\">Instructors:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-2 text-right\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"><span class=\"icon-full_star\"></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class=\"col-xs-7 col-sm-3\">Job Assistance:</div><div class=\"col-xs-5 col-sm-3 text-right\"><span>N/A</span></div></div></div><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"expandable\"><p>I signed up for the Front End Web Development course through Thinkful when I thought I was signing up for the Bootcamp Prep course. When I found out a month later that I signed up for the wrong course, I immediately thought I made a mistake, but I actually felt like I made the right choice. I learned a lot more than I thought in a short amount of time, and felt that I could use that knowledge to get into the bootcamp of my choice. After a little bit of time, I was accepted into the bootcamp that I really wanted to join and could not be any happier. I accomplished what I wanted with the program and more. I would recommend this program to anyone wanting to start learning, because it gives you a great structure to learn, and doesn't hold your hand the entire way. Finding things out on your own, and through the slack community has made me learn things better than someone just telling me the answers. Thank you Thinkful for the direction you took me.</p>\n<p class=\"review-body\"><a class=\"helpful-btn btn-inverse \" rel=\"nofollow\" data-method=\"post\" href=\"/reviews/4397/votes\">This Review Is Helpful<span class=\"helpful-count\">2</span></a></p><p class=\"inappropriate pull-right\"><a href=\"mailto:liz@coursereport.com?subject=Flagged%3A%20Thinkful%20%7C%20Great%20Course%20%7C%20id%3A%204397\">Flag as inappropriate.</a></p></div></div></div></div></div>",
