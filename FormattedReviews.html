                    <p>
                        I want to disclose that the reason I am &nbsp;a current student at Thinkful &nbsp;is made fully possible through a full tuition scholarship recipient from Out in Tech. It has been a wild adventure to get to this point of my life and it's something I wake up every day to going, \"Oh golly this really is still real and happening, that's so darling.\"<br>
                        \n<br>
                        \nFor anyone else like myself who really loves to break and find things, it truly is worth finding out how the folks &nbsp;who design the things that you like to break think. It also is most certainly helpful to be able to actually build that same thing from scratch beginning to end and ask yourself: is this actually secure, am I part of the problem, too?&nbsp;It has been an extroardinary experience working through that which I accept as a very happy challenge to myself.<br>
                        \n<br>
                        \nGoing into this program I knew I'd be going into a structured program with the trendy/popular full stack they're gearing students towards. What I didn't expect was for my mentor &nbsp;to figure out how I learn best, how I think or see problems, and use that to help me get a much richer and fuller understanding than the course itself alone. I'm a massive generalist so to have my mentor reach into my security and hacker community backgrounds &nbsp;to connect everything I know and the course together to fill in the gaps I do have has been absolutely wonderful.<br>
                        \n<br>
                        \nThe mentors are by far what truly make this program what it is for me. That's not to say the instructors and TA's aren't, they are most definitely that other huge chunk. Yet it really is up to you to decide on what path you want to take, what you want out of the program, and your mentor will be there to help guide you down the way you want to go.<br>
                        \n<br>
                        \nBefore I forget if you're in a Thinkful city like DC there are a lot of meet ups plus dinners for students and mentors together! They're absolutely darling and I highly recommend going to them even if you're not a registered student (for the regular public meet ups of course).<br>
                        \n<br>
                        \nThe full time program is intensive. If you come from prior experience, however, you may end some specific days during certain parts of the bootcamp &nbsp;earlier than expected. Especially if you know what '1=1' is for times you focus on databases. On the other hand you make up for it by helping other pairs understand it, working with your mentor on more advance concepts, and working on other things.<br>
                        \n<br>
                        \nPaired programming is something I never got to truly experience growing up messing around in the way we work in the full time program. There is a really lovely mix if folks in my cohort when it comes to prior experience. Getting a chance to work with everyone whether they have a comp sci degree or are a former lawyer is really exciting to see what they bring with them to the program.<br>
                        \n<br>
                        \nYou learn a lot about yourself, I don't think I've self reflected nearly this much about myself in how I interact with people in a long while.<br>
                        \n<br>\nThere's so much I want to talk about alas I think this is a long review already. If you really want to talk more about the program with me it shouldn't be that hard to reach me! Hope you all have a darling day.

                    <p>I have been in the &nbsp;Thinkful Flexible Bootcamp for a little over a month now. I have learned so much within this short period of time &nbsp;with the very thorough curriculum, mentorship three times a week to help me work through my most recent problems, and the community that Thinkful has around it to propel me as a lifelong learner and student of software development. I took a lot of thought into picking a coding bootcamp that helped me accomplish my goals and flexible enough to give me the opportunity to grow as a programmer.</p>
                    \n\n<p>I highly recommend Thinkful &nbsp;for anyone who wants to level up their skills. Whether it's server-side programming, learning asynchronous programming, or learning how to solve software problems with algorithms and data structures. I have been coding little over a year now. Since being in this program, I have learned invaluable advice from some of the best in the field. With all this said, &nbsp;this bootcamp gives an individual everything they need to succeed but it's up to the individual to apply and grow to acheive what they desire. Good luck and happy coding!</p>

                    <p>I would like to admit that I was a big skeptic of bootcamps and people claiming 'it was a life changing event for them', at first. Seemed like propaganda to me.</p>
                    \n\n<p>One day a friend came up to me and said that he had joined Thinkful, out of the blue mind you. Of course, this had me a little more interested in bootcamps, because now I had an inside voice and a test dummy for me. Win!</p>
                    \n\n<p>After hearing him talk about how great Thinkful is and showing me all that he has built in less than a month, I was in.</p>
                    \n\n<p>I knew I had to make a change in my career soon, and Thinkful did that just that and more for me.</p>
                    \n\n<p>After about 4 months in this course, I am still amazed how much I have actually learned in 4 months. 4 MONTHS. That is nothing realistically. But hear I am developing FULL_STACK apps, by myself and with others (pair programming is an indispensable &nbsp;skill to learn)!</p>
                    \n\n<p>Even though I am paying a tuition, I still think I won't ever be able to repay them for everything I have accomplished. From becoming a developer to all the way to learning how to work better with others, it is all thanks to them!</p>
                    \n\n<p>So if you are like I was, a skeptic, I would highly recommend you check out Thinkful.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>

                    <p>Before my first day of learning at Thinkful, I had minimal &nbsp;knowledge on programming. I dabbled with some exercises in Free Code Camp and Codeacademy, but I felt that I would personally benefit from a mentor &nbsp;who could help me further understand the logic of the code, answer my questions, and recommend best practices.&nbsp;I looked through a variety of online and on-site programs and thought that Thinkful fit my needs: it offered a flexible track (which was ideal since I worked full-time), emphasized the mentor-mentee model, had a supportive community both online and on-site, and a team from career services to guide you on the job hunt. ​</p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        <strong>Curriculum:&nbsp;</strong>
                    </p>
                    \n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I found Thinkful's curriculum to be organized and &nbsp;straightforward. They lay out the basics and take you through advanced lessons with examples and exercises. They also have assignments and capstones &nbsp;that help you really &nbsp;solidify what you have learned while being creative with your personal projects (which is always fun!).</p>
                    \n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say that there were some topics that I thought could have been explained clearly and thoroughly. With that, you would &nbsp;need to constantly use Google, StackOverflow and other resources to research topics that may seem unclear. To add onto this, you have your mentor, Thinkful/Slack community and Q &amp;A sessions hosted by mentors on a variety of topics &nbsp;that you can turn to for questions; they are usually very responsive and helpful.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>As many reviews here have said, this curriculum will be difficult at times. Given that there is so much to learn in &nbsp;a short amount of time, it is completely understandable that anyone can feel frustrated or overwhelmed (I know I did!). But don't give up! Throughout this track, you would need to stay patient, dedicated and willing to work hard. It will pay off nicely in the end, especially when you complete those capstones.</p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        <strong>Instructors/Community:</strong>
                    </p>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Students get an hour-long mentor session three times a week. Mentor sessions could include anything from curriculum Q &amp;As, coding exercises/pair programming, or interview prep. My mentor &nbsp;<span>Aleksandar Grbic &nbsp;has been nothing short of amazing. As &nbsp;someone who comes from a background completely unrelated to tech, I first felt intimidated by all the new information. Alex has helped me better understand programming concepts by offering clear &nbsp;explanations. For instance, I started off from &nbsp;\"What is an object??\" to building projects that use them.&nbsp;He has been patient, thorough, understanding, and would offer advice on real-world expectations in the world of web development, which is extremely valuable.&nbsp;</span>
                    </p>
                    \n\n<p>This may vary by city, but we have a local Thinkful group managed by the awesome &nbsp;Peter Kim in Atlanta, GA. We &nbsp;meet &nbsp;bi-weekly to meet &nbsp;other Thinkful students and mentors, showcase capstone projects &nbsp;(and gaining feedback), go through coding challenges, and ask mentors questions. We also learn more about the local tech industry through meet-ups/events or job opportunities shared by mentors and students. I love my Thinkful family and their passion for coding. I would say that our meetings have truly enriched &nbsp;my experience.</p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        <strong>Job Assistance:</strong>
                    </p>
                    \n\n<p>While I am not yet at the point of working with the career services team, I have participated in a web conference &nbsp;that interviewed Thinkful graduates &nbsp;about &nbsp;their experiences on &nbsp;finding jobs. Overall, it seemed like a positive experience. I could also note other instances where people from the Thinkful community have assisted in making the &nbsp;job hunt easier. On Slack, students would post their resumes or portfolio pages for review and receive feedback. In my local Thinkful group, we would share opportunities to attend recruiting events together. There were &nbsp;also some mentors who would assist you in finding leads in some companies.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n

                        <strong>Overall Experience:</strong>
                    </p>
                    \n\n<p>I'm currently on my fourth month of the flexible web development track, and looking back, I have to say that I definitely learned so much that I can now confidently create awesome projects that I am passionate about. Because of its dedication to student success, I would highly recommend Thinkful.</p>

                        A close friend of mine at work very randomly one day said to me \"Jeremy, you are way too smart to be stuck working here for the rest of your life. &nbsp;I was reading an article about computer coding a couple days ago, I think you should check it out.\" &nbsp;To say computer coding was not on my radar, would not even give that under statement a fair shot as an under statement. &nbsp;Let's more accurately describe my knowledge/interest in computer coding ..... I have never one time in my entire life given it an iota of thought, until Kenny approached me with the suggestion. &nbsp;So, self-inventory time, as I'm sitting at home, a few hours after Kenny had unkowingly changed the path of my existence. &nbsp;Wife-yes, Offspring-yes, Mortgage-yes, Work Stability-yes, Great Friends-yes, Basic Needs Met-yes, Good Health-yes, Complacent-yes, L

                                <span>cal-Yes, Indifferent-Yes Uninterested-yes. &nbsp;Immediately all neon arrows were pointing to the only part of my life that wasn't seemingly perfect, causing the last 4 inventory items to be Yes. &nbsp;I had been working the same brain-dead job for 7 years, and I was wasting away mentally without realizing it. &nbsp;So, yeah .... let's give computer coding a shot.</span>

                    </p>
                    \n\n<p>Currently, I am 35 years old.&nbsp;The first &nbsp;25, I spent nearly the entire year freezing to death, in nowhereville Michigan. &nbsp;The last 10, I have spent nearly the entire year sweating to death, in nowhereville Florida.</p>
                    \n\n<p>The above statement at first glance, will more often then not, be perceived as a negative statement, because of three words. &nbsp;Human nature teaches us that freezing and sweating, and of course death, are not good things.</p>
                    \n\n<p>Currently, I am 35 years old. &nbsp;The first &nbsp;25, I spent nearly the entire year cozied up next to the fireplace, in nowhereville Michigan. &nbsp;The last 10, I have spent nearly the entire year basking in the beautiful sun, in nowhereville Florida.</p>
                    \n\n<p>Not so bad after a couple replacements were inserted, eh?</p>
                    \n\n<p>I've been in the Flexible Web Development Bootcamp for just over 2 months. &nbsp;I quickly learned that if this is not something that you very very very very much, deep down, have the passion to &nbsp;apply/challenge/dedicate/sacrifice/trust yourself, to name a few ..... then you're going to view this job field as the first description of FL/MI. &nbsp;But, for me ... a fire has been lit. &nbsp;I have never been so enthralled and full of life, in my life. &nbsp;This short journey has already brought back so much of what I forgot I had inside of me, LIFE! I'm alive again, not some dope wandering through every single day, waiting for the yearly vacation.&nbsp;My wife asked me, \"Honey, why did you wait so long? You are a different person!\" That's a good question, but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer.</p>
                    \n\n<p>It's all the things that you would expect &nbsp;from a career with endless potential in a multitude of different arenas, nothing will be handed to you on a silver platter. &nbsp;This is something you take, you go get it, and you take it, and you don't slow down or stop until you get it. &nbsp;I'm not there yet, but I will be, .... oh, I will be.</p>

                        <span>B. Bowers is my mentor. &nbsp;He is one of the coolest, most laid back, unfair to the rest of society level of brilliant dudes that I have ever met. &nbsp;I have only known him for a little over 2 months and I look forward everyday, to our time spent intensely &nbsp;obsessing over whatever we are working on at the moment, both of us so locked into working the problem until it's solution is found. &nbsp;Then we enjoy a tiny shared victory, and right back in we go. &nbsp;He's the epitomy of the calm during the storm, he'll repeat the same thing to me as calm and slow &nbsp;the 7th time as he did the 1st. time he said it. &nbsp;Geniune care and concern &nbsp;for my well-being, and for the well-being of my future and that of my family, oh and btw, he is also brilliantly and seamlessly walking me properly/purposefully/perfectly into one of the most thought invoking, complex, detail oriented, do it right or don't do it at all careers in the world.</span>

During a 4 month period, from his reply to my first horrified email, to his last reply, introducing me to my mentor.(ending with 'hope to hear from you soon') &nbsp;From a standpoint of what I needed from him, in his over 20+ replies to every single of my emails, he never missed replying to one of them mind you, he absolutely could not have given me a more perfect/relevant/timely/information rich/calming/reassuring/confidence boosting response in regards to what my previous email was requesting of him, ever. &nbsp;He was overly perfect at getting me exactly and usually more than what I needed. &nbsp;Noel, brother, you are an amazing amazing man for what you do, and with the passion that you do it with over and over and over and over for all of us. &nbsp;You're never stale, it's always fresh, sincere and real. &nbsp;For that, I will forever be in your debt for guiding me through the process to get here.</p>

                        Background:<br>\nMy previous full-time job was completely unrelated to programming. I had a few hobbies that surrounded computers (gaming, computer building) and I had spent some previous time with self study using free online resources and taking a couple community college CS courses. I had tried teaching myself C++ as a young teen and quickly realized how difficult that was, thus abandoning my early CS career. My current job was very stressful with long hours and no appreciation and little to show for it. So I can to the conclusion something had to be done and decided to look back at something that had interested me enough to attempt self learning with C++.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Course:&nbsp;<br>\nI spent 3 months in this Front-End Web Development course. At that time, it was said to usually take 3-4 months for most students. The material was not that deep and kept mostly to the surface of various web development topics. This was helpful for beginners and was nice to get a overall foundation, however, you soon got to a point where you needed more advanced knowledge in order to actually do anything real world related and the course did not have support for that. In addition, the course would almost always refer to outside resources for their course content. I understand that they did not want to reinvent the wheel when a wheel was already perfectly available; it still gave the nasty taste of a company charging heavy fees to just point you to the Internet. Obviously, this material is not easy, and if you're expecting something simple and fast, you're looking in the wrong field. Having said that, this course would be great for early beginners. Though, when it comes to job application time, you will not be prepared to land a job. The skills you gain in this course are insufficient for being employed and the projects are too simple and too superficial to be of any use for anyone or to showcase necessary skills.

                    <p>
                        Mentors:&nbsp;<br>\nInitially, I was matched with a mentor who did seem very intelligent but not completely integrated into the Thinkful process. She was on the older side, which is perfectly fine, except she didn’t seem in touch with the most recent web development tools and frameworks, which was severely limited since that’s what the course was made for. She was never prepared for our meetings and only relied on me to ask questions. This was a super frustrating experience for a new developer because I did not know what I did not know and was very much relying on my mentor’s expertise to help guide the way. If I just wanted to teach myself and ask questions when I knew I had them, I would have just done freecodecamp and stackoverflow. Ultimately, I should have switched mentors to see what else was out there.

                    <p>
                        Job assistance:&nbsp;<br>\nUnfortunately, at the time of me taking this course, Thinkful promised assistance with job placement, however, they did absolutely nothing in this regard. I received no help, no communication, and no offer of assistance during my entire time in the course and since. I was very disappointed with this as even just reviewing my portfolio/online presence, or technical interview prep would have been great.
                    </p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        Overall:<br>\nThis course was sub par even considering it cost less than other bootcamps. The material is challenging in that its a new field, but you do not dig very deep, they constantly link you to other materials, career services was non-existent for me, and my mentor was not helpful. The course may be different now, but my experience was not positive.

                    <p>I took the Frontend Web Development course, and I found it to be &nbsp;great and my mentor &nbsp;very helpful. She was always &nbsp;willing to walk me through the various processes that I wasn't able to learn on my own in order to accomplish the course goals. The one on one meetings were much more valuable than the larger classroom settings I've been a part of in the past.</p>

                <div class=\"expandable\">
                    <p>I signed up in November of 2015 full of hope and excitement for my future. &nbsp;I enrolled into the front-end web development courses and also the node course. &nbsp;My first mentor was great and we got along very well. &nbsp;Then in March, 2016, I was suddenly assigned to a different mentor without any prior warning. &nbsp;I logged in to the usual session time and was told that somebody new was going to guide me through. &nbsp;At first, everything was going well, but soon he started missing sessions with no notice. &nbsp;I should have asked to get another mentor, but felt I was very close to finishing so I continued with him.</p>
                    \n\n<p>In July, 2016, my program director told me that he was confident I was ready to graduate and when I sent him my portfolio, he said that it was good enough for him and had me start working with a designer to polish it up. &nbsp;She gave me a few pointers to make my portfolio better. &nbsp;The issue with her was that she kept telling me to use my design skills, even though I never took design courses. &nbsp;I told her that I hadn't taken those courses and was only a developer, but she kept telling me to \"use your design skills, use your design skills!\"</p>
                    \n\n<p>After three months, THREE MONTHS, of this, somehow another program director got looped into the discussion and he told me that my portfolio, the very same portfolio approved by the first program director, violated Thinkful's own standards for graduation portfolios. &nbsp;At this point, I had now been enrolled in the 6-8 month program for a full year and he wanted me to redo each and every single one of my projects in the portfolio. &nbsp;When I told him that it had been approved by the other director, and that I had been in the program for over a year, he said I only had to redo two of them.</p>
                    \n\n<p>From November to December of 2016, I worked on it and the second director was telling me that everything was looking good and he would have somebody from career services reach out to me. &nbsp;All through January, 2017 I was getting this promise until one day I told him that I was tired of being strung along and either I would have contact with career services or get a refund of my tuition. &nbsp;Finally, I was put in contact with career services and started what was supposed to be six months of career placement assistance.</p>
                    \n\n<p>She bailed after two months telling me that she would have to seek approval for more sessions with me. &nbsp;The problem with that was when I signed up, at this point, 18 months prior, I was given a promise of six full months of career placement assistance. &nbsp;Understandably, I was rather confused as to why she would only work with me for two months.</p>
                    \n\n<p>I worked my tail off each day while I was taking my courses, coming home from a full-time job and putting in several hours in the evening, and several more Saturday and Sunday as well. &nbsp;I did what they asked of me and trusted them when they said I was ready to graduate and my portfolio was good enough to go. &nbsp;Now, I'm stuck in limbo, not having the promised career placement help, and they aren't responding to my emails. &nbsp;If I had to do this all over again, I would have chosen somebody else such as the Odin Project, where they don't charge tuition until after you get a job, or even Free Code Camp.</p>
                    \n\n<p>Thinkful broke every promise they made to me. &nbsp;Every single one. &nbsp;I truly regret going through this bootcamp.</p>

                        <span>
                            <span>My full-time job was completely unrelated to programming. I had a few hobbies that surrounded computers (gaming, computer building) and I had just started working on the front-end portion of a free codecademy lesson (HTML/CSS). I was looking for another career that would challenge me everyday and could give me a way to be creative and design experiences for people for a variety of reasons. This career also has the benefit of bringing in more money than I was making at my other job.</span>
                        </span>

                            <span>The Course: </span>
                        </span>
                        <br>
                        \n
                        <span>
                            <span>I've been in the 6-month flexible full stack course for about 4 months now. I have learned more practical technical skills in that time than I ever thought possible. With that said, this course is not easy, and if you're expecting something simple and fast, you're looking in the wrong field. The course is written to challenge you and force you to work through problems using skills its shown. It also challenges you to use the most important resource known to any developer: Google. I gave the Curriculum a 4/5 because at times I am frustrated by it, but that is remedied by the one-on-one attention I'm given from my mentor.</span>

                        <span>
                            <span>Initially, I was matched with a mentor who did not seem completely onboard with the whole process. I'm not sure if he was new or burnt out, but our first two conversations weren't what I was hoping to get out of the course. I spoke to my program manager and he was immediately willing to move me to another mentor, the one I currently work with, without very much prompting. I was very happy with how flexible he was willing to be to make sure I got what I needed to learn. Just being able to be open and honest with the manager has been a huge help and my new mentor is also responsive to my needs as a learner. My program manager is also always willing to meet during times available on his calendy. This is a HUGE benefit because it affords me the contact of multiple professionals in the field, giving me that much more mentorship. On top of that, Q &amp;A sessions are available from a variety of other mentors during specific times, during which I'm able to ask specific questions. Funny enough, my mentor is very much into server-side coding, and my manager is the biggest CSS/front-end enthusiast I’ve met. Having both of them to teach and guide me has been absolutely amazing.</span>

                            <span>Although I haven't even reached the end of my time in Thinkful, I’m already able to work with local mentors to start a job search. It is extremely important to attend meetups if they are available in your area, as these provide opportunities to network and meet other professionals, some of whom may be hiring. At one such meetup, I made an arrangement with a Thinkful manager to showcase one of my projects and to meet some professionals in the field at a company nearby.</span>

                    <p>Recently I completed the &nbsp;Frontend Web Development course (individual skilled course) after a period of 3 months, spending about 10/15 hours a week on the learning materials and exercises. Much more time, however, was spent on my capstone project in which you apply all you have learned.</p>
                    \n\n<p>The &nbsp;course was a great experience and very rewarding to me:</p>
                    \n\n
                    <ul>
                        \n\t<li>The web portal is very user-friendly;</li>
                        \n\t<li>The learning material is not dry and strikes the right balance between theory and practical hands-on examples;</li>
                        \n\t<li>Being paired with a mentor, though &nbsp;is in my opinion, the real key to the success of Thinkful's course concept as it will motivate &nbsp;you to stay on track and in case stuck there is help &nbsp;out there. My mentor Andrew was amazing, very experienced, great communicator and very flexible in case life got in the way. He provided me with many great (re)sources which I (will) consult on a regular &nbsp;basis going forward. Also brainstorming with him about my capstone project was fun and very helpful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                        \n
                    </ul>
                    \n\n<p>This course did not feel like any other course in the sense that pretty much from day 1 you will be hands-on with quick results. All exercises are interesting and for the more elaborate exercises (interactive quiz, capstone project) it is up to you how to fill them in, as long as it meets the given requirements.</p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        <strong>The course felt definitely more as a \"hobby\" than a \"tedious\" learning experience. </strong>

                    <p>I am currently a Thinkful student in the Flexible Web Developement Bootcamp and it has been a really great experience all around, so far. I am about a month and a half in and the one thing that has stood out to me the most is how well the mentors (and Program Managers) cater to your way of learning. They immediately get a feel for how you learn,&nbsp;what type of pace is a healthy pace for you, and &nbsp;make sure that you are enjoying your experience throughout the course. All in all, I would definitely recommend Thinkful for anyone interested in diving into the world of web developement in a new, fun way.</p>

                    <p>I thought I could teach myself to code, but after 3 years of off and on learning I knew I needed help. &nbsp;I wanted to get a job, and I had no idea how to go about getting it. &nbsp;I looked at several bootcamps and online schools, but ultimately decided to go with Thinkful. &nbsp;Here's why:</p>
                    \n\n<p>They are extremely nice. &nbsp;Everyone from the project managers to the mentors is friendly, asking how you are doing, and even chatting a bit before you get started with your meeting. This was important because everyone feels burnout while learning this stuff and it helps to chat and get a little off topic before you start diving in again.</p>
                    \n\n<p>Thinkful employees are professional. &nbsp;Everyone knows their stuff and takes the time to make sure you understand the answer to whatever you are asking. &nbsp;I've had days where I felt like learning to code is impossible and I wasnt cut out to code. &nbsp;Someone has always been there to help me learn and get back on track. &nbsp;As a side note, they never made me feel stupid for asking a question either. I really really liked that. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>The mentors are amazing. &nbsp;My mentor has been coding for 17 years! &nbsp;He knows his stuff and asks questions in a way that makes me research and know my stuff. &nbsp;And if I dont know it, we go over and over and over it. &nbsp;Hes even given me extra coding exercises for when I needed extra practice. &nbsp;And he keeps me on track. &nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Also the curriculum. &nbsp;Dont get me wrong, you could probably find this stuff on the web for free, but hey, you arent getting the mock interviews, the chats with career services, extra workshops on everything from React to Github.. Not to mention the Q &amp;A sessions for hours a day and the slack channel for students and thinkful employees to jump in and chat.</p>
                    \n\n<p>Listen, the bottom line is you get what you put in to it. &nbsp;Thinkful is a great program. &nbsp;I havent finished the course yet, but Im due to in about a &nbsp;month, and Im confident that Im getting the skills I need to succeed in todays programming atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Also special shoutout to Derek, program manager, who has talked me down from the walls and always is there to lend a helping hand. &nbsp;Hes seriously one of the best. &nbsp;Im lucky that he was part of my team.</p>
                    \n

                        <span>Before I get to the negatives I do want to say I got a lot out of this course.&nbsp;I went into the course with some degree of coding knowledge and a lot of expereince in non-technical web practices, user experience, journey etc.&nbsp;I run a small digital marketing/web business and I do a lot of web work using WordPress.&nbsp;I basically wanted to increase my technical skill-set and ultimately expand my offering to include (or at least start my journey towards offering) front-end development.</span>
                    </p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        <span>On the positive side, I felt the course material was well written and had solid depth, and many of the challenges along the way were challenging and rewarding to complete.&nbsp;Additionally, getting assigned a mentor that you catch-up with weekly is great for staying on track.&nbsp;There's also a lot of flexibility in the final \"Capstone\" project to do essentially what you'd like assuming it meets the broad criteria.&nbsp;I liked this as it essentially meant I could roll out something which I could hopefully actually sell into a client in some form at a later date.</span>
                    </p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        <span>On the negative side (and I'm really not a serial negative reviewer).&nbsp;The main disjoint for me was the amazing pre-sales help/responsive support vs the support once you are actually a student.&nbsp;Just to clarify, this is not a dig at my mentor but rather rather getting in touch anyone else.&nbsp;I felt that following submitting the Capstone there was a real dead-end and I was left thinking - have I finished?&nbsp;Did I pass?&nbsp;What can I do better?&nbsp;I sent many emails trying to clarify this process but no response, except for an automated one saying I would get a response!&nbsp;(I'm going to avoid the temptation to name names here).&nbsp;My mentor did respond who felt there should be an independent developer review but eventually he just said he was advised to do that himself in my case and I'd passed after a few minor iterations.&nbsp;I feel like he was kept in the dark as well to be honest.&nbsp;Ultimately, I would have loved some detailed feedback on my code and a formal pass email, certificate, something!&nbsp;$1500 USD and no \"closure\" just seems ridiculous to me.</span>
                    </p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        <span>I'd also point out and this is really dependant on personal learning style but this course is all written with a number of code challenges along the way (you do this using CodePen or similar).&nbsp;Personally, I learn much better with at least some video content thrown in to reinforce concepts.&nbsp;I appreciate that as a developer you need to research yourself but still I would have benefited from some video content curated by Thinkful themselves (although they do provide some great links along the way).&nbsp;I don't recall a single video as part of the core curriculum.&nbsp;</span>
                    </p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        <span>In summary, I've come a long way in three months and this is partly due to this course.&nbsp;However, knowing what I know now could I do better elseware?&nbsp;Absolutely.&nbsp;I'm currently going through the Treehouse FWED track which I'm already finding a lot more cost effective, interactive, and educational.&nbsp;I'm also slowly chipping away at free code camp which I think is a great free resource.&nbsp;My initial plan was to master the basics through this course and then progress to the Thinkful Angular course, however I'll be focusing elseware to expand my knowledge. &nbsp;I hate leaving a less than ideal review but I do feel like I've received less than ideal service in this case... it could be so much better thinkful! &nbsp;</span>

The curriculum was very well designed and the project based learning really accelerated learning the material.&nbsp;My instructor Kyle always had insightful tips and thoughtful pointers to answer my questions as well as provide support when I would get stuck. If you are looking to accelerate the learning process w/ web skills thinkful provides a great option.</p>

                    <p>I thought a lot about this review before posting it, because I haven't completed the entire &nbsp;course yet. However, I don't expect much to change, and my experience has been good! With that in mind, I haven't approached the \"Job Assistance\" process yet (5/23/2017) so I've left it N/A for now.</p>
                    \n\n<p>Assuming you understand &nbsp;that a 'Bootcamp' is a \"hit the ground &nbsp;running\" kind of thing - Thinkful has done a great job of putting together an order for learning lessons that builds upon the previous where you eventually create capstone projects that are portfolio worthy.</p>
                    \n\n<p>The curriculum has forced me to search beyond &nbsp;what is provided to gain a deeper understanding of all the concepts. My mentor has been able to clearly answer every question I've had, and Thinkful also has scheduled Q &amp;A sessions available throughout the day, where you can jump in and ask questions with a different perspective, or point of view. It's good school, but I would recommend knowing some basics before jumping in, as the pace can be quick. Stay ahead &nbsp;is key for me, while working a full-time job.</p>

                    After doing extensive research on coding boot camps, I decided to enroll in Thinkful's Web Developer flex course. I recently graduated and had an awesome experience. Here are some of the highlights of the program. \n\n1. The flexibility. I was able to continue to work my full time job without quitting. This was a huge necessity for me. I worked during the day and studied in the evenings and weekends. \n\n2. The one on one mentorship. As a novice, having a dedicated mentor that could refine my skills as I moved through the course was essential. They recently began to implement local mentors in some locations. I had a local mentor which was really helpful. Not only having a mentor with coding knowledge, but someone who had experience in the local job market was a plus. \n\n3. The price. I looked at a dozen or so boot camps and most of them were priced way out of my range. Thinkful was one of the few boot camps that I didn't feel extreme anxiety about paying for. They have many payment options including month to month, deferred and a third party loan company called SkillsFund. I used the SkillsFund loan and they were really easy to business with.\n\n4. The job report. Thinkful is one of the few boot camps that publishes job report statistics of their graduates. This was really reassuring to know where graduates usually go after finishing the course.\n\n5. The material. The course layout was designed really well. I had no experience in development before joining. The material is packaged in a way that makes it simple to learn fundamentals, practice what you've learned and use that knowledge to build applications. Each section is a building block from the previous.\n\n5. The Support. They want you to succeed and this is very apparent with the support system they've built. They have mentors that have open 'office hours' available from early in the morning to late at night to answer any questions you have. They also have a huge slack community that's available 24/7. So between your personal mentor, office hours and slack, you're always able to get help when you need it. \n\n6. The Community. All of the team members are beyond nice and genuinely care about your success and happiness. My program manager Derek was extremely helpful in making sure I had the support I needed throughout the course. The GM and Program Manager of Atlanta(Jas and Peter) do a great job of building the local community which is really helpful for current students and graduates.

                    <p>After researching &nbsp;coding botcamps, I chose Thinkful because: it offers &nbsp;the most relevant and up-to-date curriculum &nbsp;I've seen from online scholols; the teachers/program managers &nbsp;are very invoilved in your learning experience and are quick to respond.</p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        I started the Thinkful Felxible bootcamp with absolutely no prior experience in coding. The curriculum &nbsp;covers HTML, CSS, the command line (Git/GitHub etc)&nbsp;with lots of drills at the end of each &nbsp;lesson. They make sure you get solid foundations before you actually start programming in JavaScript and using JQuery, APIs etc.<br>\nOnce you have completed the front-end section, you move on to the server-side.&nbsp;You also learn about more advanced topics in Computer Science which is an aspect lots of bootcamps &nbsp;tend to overlook.
                    </p>
                    \n\n<p>Apart form the curriculum, the strength of this program lies in the projects you work on, the portfolio you build &nbsp;and the three weekly 1-1 &nbsp;mentor sessions –coupled &nbsp;with lots of daily live Q &amp;A and workshops–&nbsp;that help you overcome the challenges of programming.</p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        This is an online school, however you are not on your own...far from it.<br>\nThanks to Kristen, Mark and Derek by the way.
                    </p>
                    \n\n
                    <p>
                        <br>\nHighly recommended.
                    </p>

                    <p>I looked around at several bootcamps before choosing Thinkful. I moved ahead with them because they offer several options to 'try-before-you-buy' so I felt confident that if I decided this wasn't the right place for me, I could back out without loosing a ton of money. Once I got going, I realized I really loved to code and have been loving the courses &nbsp;ever since. I've been working as a nanny so I haven't been paying for child care for my own kid for the past few years and I realized if I did an in-person bootcamp, I would not only be paying for the school but also need to find care for her while I was there and not be able to work even part-time and that was too much. With Thinkful's flex-program, I've been able to keep working part-time and &nbsp;be with my daughter while working through the course materials. I still had the support of an individual mentor at all times and constant access to other support through Q &amp;A sessions and the slack community. Atlanta has also become a very tight-knit family where we meet up in person a couple of times a month so I wound up still getting some of the most fun parts of an in-person bootcamp without needing to leave everything else &nbsp;for 4+ months.</p>

                    <p>I recently wanted to make a career switch, and thought that programming and software were always something that interested me. So, I decided to do research and research and research, and did not get anywhere until I saw thinkful. Up until that point, everything was either expensive, weird, or plain old garbage. So, I then got in touch with Benjy.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>From there, he took care of my every concern and worry. Not only did he do that, but the onboarding process for this company is serious. The whole staff works to make sure you have everything you need to allow you to work hard and learn this tough stuff. So, with the help of thinkful, what I would have learned in 6 months on my own, I learned in a week with thinkful, no exaggeration.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Here is why. Plain and simple. When you learn, you need knowledge and practice. For knowledge, you need to know, what to learn and then best sources. Thinkful, gives you structure from A-Z, and guides you in the right direction. Different from being self taught and going at it blindly. This is more strategic honestly. On top of that your mentor is also there, so you have an expert right at your fingertips who actually becomes a friend like mine did. Then you need practice, and Thinkful gives you plenty of it. You learn through rigorous drills, and then capstone projects. Amazing way of learning, why? Well you practice all of the small pieces that will makeup your capstone later on. Practice makes perfect, you succeed in projects, and you will feel great.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Also, YES, you could learn programming like anything else by yourself. But honestly, time is spare, so why waste it. Unless you actually like devling into the unkown, and don't give up, join Thinkful. They give you a free trial. No other bootcamp will care about you enough to let you try them.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Shoutout to my mentor Juan, amazing guy. Will always be a friend and mentor.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n

                <div class=\"expandable\">
                    <p>I started the Flexible Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp with Thinkful in summer 2016 with only some knowledge of HTML, and an awareness of CSS. &nbsp;I was working in email marketing (where I learned some HTML) and enjoyed it, so I wanted to learn more. &nbsp;If you're like me &nbsp;and can't pay attention in a physical class, Thinkful's online bootcamp is great. &nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>The Flexible course is paced so that you can go at your own speed, and it provides relevant examples along the course as you learn, so it's not just pure text reading. &nbsp;You do need to be willing to dedicate and put it in the time and &nbsp;effort into going through the material and practices/projects when you're by yourself, but having a mentor work with you 1 on 1 is amazing and helps you through it when you're stuck or just have questions. &nbsp;Also, special shoutout to Capi for being awesome and patient with me through the entire course!</p>
                    \n\n<p>There are also a lot of sessions that you can join throughout the week to ask questions from other mentors, and I highly recommend taking advantage of &nbsp;those. &nbsp;Sometimes even if you don't have a question, you can pick up some stuff from other students asking questions.</p>
                    \n\n<p>I finished the course in about 6 months after portfolio reviews and started working with Career Services. &nbsp;Thinkful does guarantee a job after the course, however &nbsp;they're not going to just give one to you. &nbsp;You need to put in the work in searching, applying, and interviewing, but they make sure to help you through the entire process. &nbsp;Resume and portfolio reviews, interview practice,&nbsp;suggestions/resources on whiteboarding, and a Career Services &nbsp;mentor &nbsp;are all part of the package. Also, a special shoutout to Rob for always taking the time to meet &nbsp;and pep-talk me before my interviews! &nbsp;Thinkful Slack is &nbsp;helpful during this process in the careers chat too. &nbsp;You can get tips from the people in Career Services there or from other students. &nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Learning web development in a short time isn't easy, but I feel that Thinkful does a great job in getting you skilled and ready. &nbsp;Two months after I finished the course, I got a contract as a junior front end web developer, and I'm making more than I used to doing something I enjoy a lot more.</p>

                    <p>A summing up of my experience with the Front-End Developer track:</p>
                    \n\n
                    <ul>
                        \n\t<li>Wonderful curriculum rich with information that is otherwise hard to find</li>
                        \n\t<li>Curriculum is meaningful, fun, and fast-paced. No fluff or information you could quickly google.</li>
                        \n\t<li>Very practical information that I could use</li>
                        \n\t<li>Lessons flowed logically and reviewed previous content</li>
                        \n\t<li>Tons of outside resources and references to modern tooling</li>
                        \n\t<li>Mentorship was the best part. I got a mentor that fit my needs very well. Got decent feedback and answers to questions.</li>
                        \n\t<li>Mentorship sessions were very much led by me and how much coding I got done that &nbsp;week. If I did have a lot of questions prepared the lesson wouldn't be as rewarding.&nbsp;</li>
                        \n\t<li>Curriculum was project-based. No useless certifications. Only real results I could show an employer and that would prepare me for real-world projects. Final project was a portolfio website that showcases all of my projects.&nbsp;</li>
                        \n\t<li>Workshops were frequent and were mostly great. Some workshops didn't reallty touch on a lot of content. Others had my notebook filled with great tips.</li>
                        \n
                    </ul>
                    \n\n<p>This experience really jump-started my web development career and I got a job within 3 months of graduating. Strongly recommended!</p>
                    \n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Note: Edited to add background and note at end</p>
                    \n\n<p>I graduated from the Full-Time &nbsp;Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in the beginning of April. I'm now 2 weeks into the job search.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Background:</p>
                    \n\n<p>I joined Thinkful &nbsp;after an 18 month stint in the banking industry in NYC. That was my first job after graduating college. Prior to taking the course, I took a 4 week bootcamp &nbsp;prep course offered by another bootcamp institution. &nbsp;In addition, I completed the Javascript track on Codecademy. Other than that, I had never been exposed to programming in any meaningful way.</p>
                    \n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Overall Experience:</p>
                    \n\n<p>I could not be more happy with my experience at Thinkful. Thinkful provides a comprehensive suite of services to their students from day 1 &nbsp;to the day you land your first job (and beyond). The instructors, the TAs, the mentors, the program director and the career services advisers share one common trait: they care deeply about your success. This is what drives the entire process at Thinkful &nbsp;and it's what makes their program stand out from the rest.</p>
                    \n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Instructors:</p>
                    \n\n<p>The instructors at Thinkful &nbsp;are top notch. They are tremendously knowledgeable and passionate about what they do. Joe and Ben were extremely responsive to our questions and they were always willing to clarify and expand &nbsp;on topics when necessary. The TA's (who join the class for several hours every day) were excellent at explaining difficult topics, guiding students through bugs, and suggesting improvements to code. Every weeknight, students meet 1 on 1 with Mentors who are there to answer &nbsp;questions related to coding, technology, languages, frameworks, jobs etc. I looked forward to my meetings with my Mentor every single day. Finally, Thinkful &nbsp;offers several live Q &amp;A sessions every evening where subject matter experts are on hand to answer questions related to all things programming.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Curriculum:</p>
                    \n\n<p>The skills taught at Thinkful are highly relevant in the job market today. The primary stack is MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. This seems to be the most commonly desired stack among employers in early 2017. I feel like I'm well-prepared to contribute to a development team. With that said, the curriculum at Thinkful is very flexible. When technologies change, Thinkful &nbsp;adjusts quickly. Furthermore, Thinkful &nbsp;also reserves the right to make adjustments to the curriculum on a daily basis in order to address difficulties that the class might be having as a whole.</p>
                    \n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Job Assistance:</p>
                    \n\n<p>I am still early in the job search process, but Thinkful has been very helpful so far. They take it upon themselves to connect you with employers. Not only that, but they provide you with resources such as career coaching, interview prep, portfolio review, resume editing and more. Even though I \"graduated\" a few weeks ago, I feel like Thinkful is as involved as ever.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I recently finished the full-time web dev bootcamp. Highlights: strong course material, helpful online community, and lots of in-depth, student-driven projects that I had a lot of fun with — and they look great in a portfolio. Lows: Mentors are hit or miss, and the daily in-person lectures are often just repetition of the course material and also are limited by the online format, so they're not super engaging or interactive. The lectures in particular are a casualty of the online format, but overall, if you're looking specifically for a remote bootcamp, I'd recommend Thinkful.</p>

                    <p>I &nbsp;have switched 3 mentors, and it's a common situation. If you could be assigned &nbsp;&nbsp;a mentor who is responsible, willing to help you, lead you, I'd say you are super lucky.</p>
                    \n\n<p>My second mentor spent 2 whole sessions to debug a typo, refused to take a look at my code, and told me that was not his responsibility to take a look at students' code :) Funny</p>
                    \n\n<p>My third mentor was much smarter than the last one, however he ignored my messages for most of the time, when you get stuck and nobody could help you out, the feeling is fantastic:)&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>Then I started my career service. They have this strict rule says if students don't show up in the session for twice, they will lose the 6- month job guarantee. So be careful and read the email once the career service send to you , don't act like me chose to take it as an automatically assigning email and ignore it, because nobody will tell you that unless you break the rules.&nbsp;</p>
                    \n\n<p>The funniest thing was, my career coach &nbsp;forgot to send me invitations which include session link and time each week( they have the rule that mentors and coaches have to send out invitations each week to remind students). And I totally forgot about our meetings because I have a very small brain :). Although I was sitting in the front of computer thinking about my life, and one single slack message could remind me of this meeting, however my career coach chose not to, instead sending me very caring and considering &nbsp;&nbsp;emails 3 hrs later after the sessions were over, told me I lost my job guarantee. Here is the funniest part, I explained to career service manager and my program manager that my coach never sent me the invitations, and she suddenly realized she made this mistake and changed the date information of my first agreed invitation, screenshot to the managers. So now I'm not only a irresponsible person but also a lair :). I cried for whole day, and explained everything to my program manager, I asked the receipt emails of agreed invitations to prove myself, he ignored me, and after I was reassigned a new career coach, the last one started sending out the invitations LOL. Such a unforgettable experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
