This module containst the code to parse the HTML content from the screen scraping files received daily.

Here you can find the code for the SQL CRL functions. 

These functions would be called by SQL scripts at the time that data is being loaded to perform the

The whole process would be driven by SQL scripts, more information about this can be found in the
ReviewsETL project.
